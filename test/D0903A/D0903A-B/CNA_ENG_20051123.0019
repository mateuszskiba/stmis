With the government's efforts to promote
renewable energy, the installation density of solar water heaters in
Taiwan is the third-highest in the world, Vice Economics Minister Hou
Ho-shong said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar held by the Chung Hua Institution for
Economic Research on the impact of soaring oil prices on the economy,
Hou pointed out that the government is trying to work out plans for
energy conservation and the enhancement of energy efficiency to cope
with the high oil prices.
</P>
<P>
These include a plan to amend the Energy Management Law to
regulate energy efficiency and to enact a renewable energy
development law with the goal of seeing renewable energy generation
reach 5,130 megawatts, or 10 percent of the total capacity generated
by the country's power stations, by 2010, Hou said.
</P>
<P>
Hou noted that the government is promoting the use of various
renewable energy sources, including wind force, solar power, solar
thermal, biomass energy and geothermal energy.
</P>
<P>
The government is also planning to set up a solar-heating indoor
swimming pool this year, Hou said.
</P>
<P>
Hou said the government has subsidized the installation of 74
solar power systems with a total generation capacity of 647
kilowatts, including one at the Presidential Office, and is carrying
out a "solar-powered city" project in Tainan County.
</P>
<P>
Also, the government is expected to complete the country's first
geothermal power plant in Ilan County in 2007, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hou said, the government is planning to replace all
the traffic lights around the country with energy-conserving light
emitting diodes (LEDs) next year.
</P>
<P>
With the international oil prices rising to as high as US$70 per
barrel in August and fluctuating around US$57 per barrel at present,
the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Ministry of Finance have
suggested that the Cabinet lower the taxes on gasoline, diesel and
fuel oil by 25 percent until Dec. 31 in an effort to stabilize
domestic consumer prices, he said.
