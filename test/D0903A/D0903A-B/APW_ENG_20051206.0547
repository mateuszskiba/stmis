Greece's president and prime minister have agreed to install solar panels at
their official residences following a plea by the environmental group
Greenpeace, the development ministry said Tuesday.

"The president agreed, with great pleasure, to proceed with a feasibility study
on installing solar power cells at the presidential residence," Development
Minister Dimitris Sioufas said after meeting President Karolos
Papoulias.

He said Prime Minister Costas Caramanlis and the speaker of Greece's parliament
had also agreed to go solar.

Last week, Greenpeace criticized Greece's government for failing to promote the
use of the sun in power generation. The environmental group said it would pay
for solar panels to be installed at Caramanlis' residence.
