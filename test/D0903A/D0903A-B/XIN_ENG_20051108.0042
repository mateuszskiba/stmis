<P>
The Indonesian government is 
planning to build thousands of small scale solar power units and 
microhydro plants on its eastern islands next year to boost power 
capacity in remote areas.
</P>
<P>
The government will build 15,000 household solar power units, 
each with a capacity of 100 watts, the Ministry of Energy and 
Mineral Resources' Director General of Electricity and Energy Yogo
Pratomo was quoted Tuesday by The Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the (small-scale) power units will meet electricity 
demand in remote areas in eastern Indonesia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Each of the solar cell units will cost between 5 million rupiah
(500 US dollars) and 6 million rupiah in construction.
</P>
<P>
"However, they won't use any fuel except sunlight so there is 
no extra expense," said Yogo.
</P>
<P>
Aside from utilizing sunlight, the government also plans to 
build 200 microhydro power plants with a capacity of between 50 
kilowatts (kW) and 500 kW each. Investment needed for every kW is 
estimated at 20 million rupiah (2,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The development of power capacity in the country has been 
hampered due to a lack of funds since the monetary crisis severely
hit the country in 1997, despite the steadily rising demand.
</P>
<P>
State-run electricity company PLN is focusing its expansion on 
Java -- where more than half of the country's population live and 
an estimated 70 percent of the country's economic activity is 
located -- Bali and Sumatra. The company has allocated just 17 
percent of its projects for other islands.
</P>
<P>
The latest data from the World Bank shows that the 
electrification ratio in Java reaches 72 percent, while that in 
Maluku is limited to 50 percent. Only one in five people enjoys 
the luxury of electricity in natural resource-rich Papua, 
Indonesia's least-developed province.
</P>
<P>
Despite massive potential, power plants using renewable energy 
sources contribute only a small portion of the country's total 
installed power capacity of about 25,000 megawatts (MW).
</P>
<P>
The installed capacity of mini and micro hydropower plants is 
only 54 MW, while those utilizing geothermal and biomass energy 
have installed capacity of 800 MW and 302 MW, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The government aims to raise the use of new and renewable 
energy sources in power generation from 0.2 percent currently to 4
percent by 2020.
