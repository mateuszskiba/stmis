Lawmakers Ponder Sunset Provision of Patriot Act

When Congress enacted the Patriot Act after the Sept.
11 attacks, it put the Justice Department on a short leash, mandating
that many of the new powers in the act would last only four years
unless renewed by Congress.
</P>
<P>
Now, as lawmakers are debating an administration proposal to make
those provisions permanent, Republicans and Democrats are wondering
whether they should retain the ``sunset'' provisions to ensure a
degree of Justice Department accountability.
</P>
<P>
The issue is apt to become an important part of the debate as
Cong Congress every couple of years
and justify the provisions,'' a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
``There seems to be strong bipartisan support for keeping sunsets
in the Patriot Act, even after Congress decides what parts will be
reauthorized and what parts will be amended,'' said Gregory Nojeim,
associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union legislative
office.
</P>
<P>
``It appears that members believe that the sunset helps encourage
the Department of Justice to be more forthcoming with information
about how the Patriot Act is being used,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the uncertain fate of the law has resulted in a burst of
detailed new information from the Justice Department about how it has
been used.
</P>
<P>
At a Senate hearing Tuesday, Gonzales released declassified
information showing how often the department had used powerful new
tools under the law. These included provisions covering the collection
of a wide range of business records, and search warrants that allow
the government to delay notifying the target of a warrant until
sometimes weeks or months after the search has taken place, a practice
critics call ``sneak and peek.''
</P>
<P>
The department also gave Congress a 69-page analysis of how the
expiring provisions have operated..
</P>
<P>
``I think it's a strong record of success. I think that the act has
been effective. I think that the department has acted responsibly,''
Gonzales said.
