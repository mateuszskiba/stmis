President George W. Bush on Monday urged Congress to reauthorize the USA Patriot
Act, the Justice Department's widely criticized anti-terrorism
law.
</P>
<P>
"We must not allow the passage of time or the illusion of safety to weaken our
resolve in this new war" on terrorism, Bush said at a swearing-in ceremony for
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales at the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
The president also argued that the Senate must give his nominees for the federal
bench up-or-down votes without delay to fill vacancies in the
courts.
</P>
<P>
The Patriot Act, passed in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, bolstered
FBI surveillance and law-enforcement powers in terror cases, increased use of
material witness warrants to hold suspects incommunicado for months, and allowed
secret proceedings in immigration cases.
</P>
<P>
Civil liberties groups and privacy advocates lambasted the law because they said
it undermines freedom. But Bush said the act "has been vital to our success in
tracking terrorists and disrupting their plans." He noted that many key elements
of the law are set to expire at the end of the year and said Congress must act
quickly to renew it.
</P>
<P>
The Patriot Act was pushed by Gonzales' predecessor, John Ashcroft, who was in
the audience as Gonzales took his oath from Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor. Bush lauded Ashcroft's tireless efforts to make America safer as he
oversaw a drop in violent crime besides his counterterrorism
work.
</P>
<P>
Gonzales, who served as White House counsel during the last four years, said he
would be a part of Bush's team but his first allegiance will be to the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that in the days and years ahead we in the department will work
together tirelessly to address terrorism and other threats to our nation and to
confront injustice with integrity and devotion to our highest ideals," Gonzales
said.
