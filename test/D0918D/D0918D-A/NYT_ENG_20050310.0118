GIVING VOICE TO MOMS' ANXIETY

When Judith Warner was researching her book "Perfect Madness,"
a sharply observed study of motherhood in today's culture, the
TV series "Desperate Housewives" was not yet part of the
zeitgeist.
</P>
<P>
But the book and the TV soap sing an almost perfect
duet of disharmony together, each from a distinct point of
view. The TV character most stay-at-home moms identify with is
Lynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman), the frazzled mother who gave up
her career to raise an unmanageable brood, and who feels
she can never quite catch up to her life.
</P>
<P>
And that feeling is one of the threads that run through
"Madness," which has ridden a surge of media attention (a
Newsweek cover story, two big pops on the "Today" show
with Katie Couric) to debut at No. 9 on The
New York Times Bestseller List.
</P>
<P>
"There's a widespread feeling in the culture now that things have
gone too far, that there's this insanity, and I think
Lynette and my book both tap that feeling," Warner says.
</P>
<P>
But where the jolts of recognition in "Housewives" are embedded in
silliness, "Perfect Madness" is perfectly serious, a book that strives
to be an updated take on Betty Friedan's groundbreaking "The
Feminine Mystique." Friedan wrote about "The Problem That Has No
Name" (but which had much to do with being desperate
and a housewife), and Warner is concerned about "The New
Problem That Has No Name," which bundles together many things,
including motherhood, perfectionism and guilt.
</P>
<P>
"That caught-by-the-throat feeling so many mothers have today of always doing
something wrong," she calls it.
</P>
<P>
Warner has received a lot of response from mothers about "Madness."
</P>
<P>
"I hear the positive feedback, 'cause that's what they'll tell me
to my face," she says. But she also has read
some of the Web log responses, which cover a wide
range.
</P>
<P>
One blogger accused her of being a sniper in the "Mommy
Wars" -- mothers criticizing other mothers for staying home, for
working in an office, for using or not using day
care, for being too involved or not involved enough.
</P>
<P>
Warner disagrees.
</P>
<P>
"This is not mommy bashing," Warner says of the book.
</P>
<P>
Warner, the mother of daughters ages 4 and 7, was a
Newsweek correspondent based in Paris, where she saw much more
support for young mothers. When she moved back to Washington,
she was appalled by the parents who camped out in
line to get their children into the right preschool, who
medicated their children for the tiniest reason and who obsessively
bought every Baby Einstein and Baby Mozart product that came
out.
</P>
<P>
"A generation of control freaks" she calls them in the book.
She is both one of them herself, she acknowledges, and
an observer, apart.
</P>
<P>
An example, she says, is occupational therapy for preschoolers. "I don't
know about the rest of the country," she said, "but
in New York and Washington, D.C., tons and tons of
kids are in OT to work on their fine motor
skills. You have schools where practically every 4-year-old boy is
in OT to improve his handwriting and scissor skills. Anyone
with a grain of common sense knows this is excessive."
</P>
<P>
The overall tone of "Madness" is sympathetic to moms.
</P>
<P>
But Warner can be critical of "hyperparenting," and she finds plenty
of other groups to criticize for the mom madness, including:
</P>
<P>
The media. Especially magazines that seem obsessed with chronicling what some
call "the work-life balance" -- articles that Warner says can
make mothers feel inadequate. "Nearly every story comes with a
message: You can take control," she writes.
</P>
<P>
Husbands, for obvious reasons. She recounts excerpts from the interviews she
conducted with several hundred women. The anger and frustration over
how little men help with child-rearing comes pouring out. "I
have learned that I am basically going it alone," one
woman tells her -- sounding exactly like Lynette.
</P>
<P>
Advocates of all stripes. "The culture wars between social conservatives and
feminists, which take place far from the concerns of most
Americans," she writes, "are a huge and terrible waste of
resources. They have left women holding the bag, with virtually
nothing to show for themselves, after three decades of women's
'liberation' and of New Right 'family values' activism."
</P>
<P>
Society. "It's really your country -- and not your child, not
your family, not yourself -- that is entirely out of
control," she writes. She argues for a nonpartisan agenda of
social changes that would include affordable and high-quality day care,
health care for part-time workers and their families, and incentives
for businesses with pro-family policies, saying most of that could
be accomplished with changes in the tax laws.
</P>
<P>
"I kept the political part of it really short, to about
a chapter," she says, "but I've been shocked by the
extent people are interested in the policy implications."
</P>
<P>
"We need to start looking critically at family dynamics -- the
stress, the perpetual motion, the anxiety. My critique is primarily
aimed at society, not at mothers."
