Betty Friedan, who championed the once-radical assertion that women needed more
than husbands and children to find fulfillment, was eulogized Monday as a
feminist pioneer and loving mother _ if not always an easy one to live
with.
</P>
<P>
"I truly believe that Betty Friedan was the most influential woman, not only of
the 20th century but of the second millennium," said Muriel Fox, one of the
co-founders with Friedan of the National Organization for Women.
</P>
<P>
Colleagues from the American women's movement as well as her three children and
their families were among more than 300 mourners at the funeral for Friedan, who
died of congestive heart failure Saturday on her 85th birthday.
</P>
<P>
Friedan's son Jonathan remembered his mother hard at work writing "The Feminine
Mystique" _ the 1963 manifesto that shattered the cozy family ideal of the
prosperous postwar era _ while her three children bounced around their New York
City apartment.
</P>
<P>
"Betty was not the perfect mother," he said. "Emily, Daniel and I ate TV dinners
growing up way beyond the recommended limit." But when tens of thousands of
people cheered his mother at a rally when he was 17, "my heart, despite its
adolescent shell, burst with pride."
</P>
<P>
Friedan's daughter, Dr. Emily Friedan, called her mother "a mass of
contradictions."
</P>
<P>
"She made so many connections and yet was exquisitely lonely," she said. "Maybe
the ultimate contradiction was that Betty just didn't fit into this world. That
was her curse, and yet she started a revolution."
</P>
<P>
Former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman said she struggled to keep up with
Friedan at women's rights marches because Friedan "had enough energy for all of
us."
</P>
<P>
"Betty liberated our minds, and the gift of freedom is one of the most important
things that we can have," Holtzman said.
</P>
<P>
Several speakers remembered Friedan as a loving person who could also be feisty
and difficult.
</P>
<P>
"She was always very sweet and loving to me but when it came to other people she
just didn't take any (expletive) from anyone," said her 23-year-old grandson,
Raphael Friedan. "She was definitely the coolest grandmother that a young guy
like me could ask for."
</P>
<P>
He recalled how his grandmother took him to Cuba and let him throw big parties
at her summer house in Sag Harbor on Long Island, near New York
City.
</P>
<P>
Six of Friedan's nine grandchildren accompanied her plain wooden coffin out of
Riverside Memorial Chapel in Manhattan after the service. She was to be buried
in Sag Harbor.
