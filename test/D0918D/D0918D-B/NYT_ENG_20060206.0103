FRIEDAN HELPED GIVE US CHOICES
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Betty Friedan, rest in peace. You helped spark a revolution of
thought that galvanized a nation of women to reject the
1950s cookie-cutter lifestyle that revolved around being wife, mother, housekeeper
and cook.
</P>
<P>
It's hard to imagine women living a prefabricated life, tucked amid
cul-de-sacs in mass-produced homes in leafy suburbs -- the kind
of lifestyle you railed against.
</P>
<P>
The woman who headed my family then never knew such a
world.
</P>
<P>
While middle- and upper-middle-class women, most of them white, related to
"The Feminine Mystique" -- Friedan's 1963 critique of domesticity --
my mom was struggling to save her marriage while working
as a seamstress and raising two children.
</P>
<P>
No. 3 (me) came along later. Six years after I was
born, Mom and Dad divorced, meaning she was not only
mom, cook, housekeeper and breadwinner, she'd also take up the
slack as dad.
</P>
<P>
This was the reality of single mothers in my 'hood, who
didn't have the luxury of time to fret about a
life interrupted. They gladly would have traded places with educated
women of privilege who felt trapped in their suburban world.
</P>
<P>
Women of my generation only know what we've read about those
changing times and what our moms have told us.
</P>
<P>
Back then, my mom was encouraged to go to "secretarial school"
while women like Friedan graduated from elite colleges only to
be ushered to a life serving her husband and children.
</P>
<P>
Which is worse: having little hope, or having hopes raised, then
crushed?
</P>
<P>
Even though poor women of my mother's generation could not relate
to women like Friedan, they would benefit from the trickle-down
effect the women's movement had.
</P>
<P>
Taking college courses at night, my mom earned a bachelor's degree
in the early '80s. Professors encouraged her to pursue a
master's degree.
</P>
<P>
Friedan, who died Saturday at age 85, helped empower women to
fight for parity with men: equal jobs, equal pay and
equal respect.
</P>
<P>
Those heading the movement did not clamor for poor women to
have access to college grants, job training and day care.
Though most single mothers living in poverty didn't directly benefit
from the women's movement, many of their daughters have. That
is, if they had a combination of strong mentors, luck
and will.
</P>
<P>
The gains for women overall have been tremendous, and it happened
because women like Friedan were stoking the flames of action,
getting women organized and demanding change.
</P>
<P>
Still, we have a long way to go, baby.
</P>
<P>
There are eight female CEOs heading up Fortune 500 companies. Women
own fewer than 30 percent of nonfarm businesses in the
U.S., according to a January report by the U.S. Census
Bureau. Yet, women-owned businesses are growing at twice the rate
of the national average.
</P>
<P>
Women account for 20 percent of college presidents. Yet, at 56
percent of the college undergraduate population, women outnumber men in
college.
</P>
<P>
Our societal views have changed too. Most men don't expect to
marry a woman who will stay home and play the
role of housekeeper, mother and cook -- not that there's
anything wrong with it if it's the woman's choice.
</P>
<P>
Over lunch last week, an acquaintance told me she and her
husband didn't plan to have children. Just like that. No
whispering. No guilt.
</P>
<P>
That's the gift Friedan gave women. Our worth isn't determined by
our marital status. Divorced women are no longer viewed as
used goods. Single women who have passed age 35 are
no longer spinsters. It's freeing.
</P>
<P>
But there are some things that are hard to liberate ourselves
of: Middle-class single women may be independent and career-minded, but
they still have to do their own laundry.
