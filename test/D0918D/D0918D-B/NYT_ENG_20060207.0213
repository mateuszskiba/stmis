Cox News Service DAYTON, Ohio -- In 1962, when she was
six months' pregnant with her first child, Judy Mott was
laid off from her job with Sears. "It's against store
policy," her bosses told her curtly.

customers.
</P>
<P>
With her husband in college, Mott was the family's primary breadwinner.
</P>
<P>
But she knew it wouldn't do any good to protest.
</P>
<P>
She couldn't have known she was only a year away from
an event that would change everything: The publication of Betty
Friedan's "The Feminine Mystique."
</P>
<P>
Mott wondered if today's young women even know of Friedan's existence,
let alone what a difference she made in their lives.
Last year, her granddaughter, Jennifer Mott, a junior at Centerville
High School, wrote an insightful essay about Friedan's importance to
the feminist movement. "It blew me away," said Mott, community
development manager for Montgomery County.
</P>
<P>
Adds Jennifer: "I wouldn't have the choices that I have today
if it weren't for the courage of women like Betty
Friedan."
</P>
<P>
The New York Times concurred in its front-page article Monday about
Friedan's death at 85, noting that her "searing first book,
"The Feminine Mystique," ignited the contemporary women's movement in 1963
and as a result permanently transformed the social fabric of
the United States and countries around the world."
</P>
<P>
For a woman who created such a dramatic change in our
society, Friedan's death caused remarkably little stir. I winced at
the news reports that misspelled her last name as "Freidan."
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Mott acknowledges that few of her peers have heard of
Friedan. "When I was doing my paper it really stuck
out to me that she's one of the reasons I
can have goals, go to college, and major in something
meaningful to me," she said. "She grew up at a
time when it was considered the natural goal for women
to be a wife and drive the kids to Boy
Scouts and Girl Scouts and not to have any underlying
desires. She respected motherhood, but wanted women to know it
was OK to want something more."
</P>
<P>
Why was her death accorded little of the reverence shown this
week at the passing of another giant, Coretta Scott King?
</P>
<P>
A partial explanation is that feminism remains a movement that gets
little respect. It's more likely the butt of a joke
or a Rush Limbaugh rant about "feminazis." Sometimes people will
tell you they believe in equal rights for women but
hasten to add, "I'm not a feminist," as if there's
no correlation between the two concepts.
</P>
<P>
But part of the reason for Friedan's relative obscurity is the
very success of her movement. "In later years," The Times
article noted, "some feminists dismissed Ms. Friedan's work as outmoded."
</P>
<P>
It's hard to imagine, today, a world in which companies routinely
fired women for being pregnant. Jennifer Mott had never heard
the story about how her grandmother lost her job at
Sears when she was pregnant with Jennifer's father, Norb Mott.
</P>
<P>
But she'll never forget her grandmother's constant words of encouragement: "You
can do anything you want to do."
</P>
<P>
It's a lesson she learned from Betty Friedan.
