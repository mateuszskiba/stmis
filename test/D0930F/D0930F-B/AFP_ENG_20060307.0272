New industrial technologies 
and novel financial ideas can help the fight against global warming 
by cutting greenhouse gas emissions, according to scientists and 
climate experts gathered here by the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Among new technologies, "carbon capture and sequestration" made 
more converts, and trading in carbon emissions rights on financial 
markets got an encouraging boost at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Some scientists proposed a new concept of bringing together all 
the different methods of cutting greenhouse gases so that important 
progress made in each individual sector can contribute to worldwide 
climate stabilization.
</P>
<P>
"Do we have to wait for new technologies or do we have the 
technlogies today to address climate change?" World Bank Chief 
Scientist and Senior Advisor Robert Watson asked on opening the 
energy conference here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which has refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol 
on global greenhouse gas emissions, put much stock in new 
technologies to cut heat-trapping pollution.
</P>
<P>
But the Kyoto signataries are skeptical that technology alone 
can do the trick as they go ahead with their commitment to slash 
total greenhouse gas emissions by 2012 to five percent below the 
level they were in 1990.
</P>
<P>
"Countries that have decided to go down the road of technologies 
must have the responsability to tell the world if it is working or 
not," Netherlands Minister for Development Cooperation Agnes Van 
Ardenne told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Carbon capture and sequestration was showcased as a promising 
technology by Robert Socolow, a Princeton University energy and 
environment expert. Tests run in Norway and Algeria were promising, 
he said, and BP was about to announce a major carbon capture project 
in California.
</P>
<P>
The technique consists of capturing carbon gas emissions from 
power companies and injecting them in porous sediments beneath the 
ocean bottom where they can remain "sequestered" for thousands of 
years.
</P>
<P>
It is part of Socolow's theory of "stabilization wedges," which 
takes its name from the triangular-shaped metal used to break wood 
into smaller pieces. It defines sectors where the biggest efforts 
should be made to make a difference in the fight against global 
warming.
</P>
<P>
Published in Science Magazine in August 2004, Socolow's theory 
aims at solving global climate problems in 50 years by using 
existing technologies.
</P>
<P>
The wedges are the development of renewable sources of energy in 
15 sectors including, new propulsion systems for vehicles, carbon 
sequestration, nuclear energy, biomass and the environment.
</P>
<P>
According to Socolow, if significant progress is made in seven 
of the 15 sectors, worldwide carbon dioxide levels in 2055 can be 
the same as in 2005.
</P>
<P>
In the financial world, the development of markets for trading 
in pollution rights is increasingly being used as an environmental 
policy tool for pollution control.
</P>
<P>
Currently installed in Chicago, Illinois, London and soon in 
Canada, the pollution rights market allows firms and investors to 
trade the right to emit specific pollutants the same as stocks. The 
tonne of carbon at present is valued at around 100 dollars.
</P>
<P>
European governments, which have signed the Kyoto Protocol, are 
more active on the pollution rights markets than the United States.
</P>
<P>
But several US companies such as Ford, International Paper, IBM, 
American Electric Power, as well as cities and state governments 
such as New Mexico have also begun trading on the new markets.
