ROMNEY REOPENS TALKS ON EMISSIONS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney's office reopened discussions Wednesday with eight other
states that are trying to forge a landmark emission reduction
plan for power plants, but it was unclear if any
compromise might be reached.
</P>
<P>
Seven of those states decided last week to move forward without
Massachusetts because of Romney's reluctance to act on the greenhouse
gas pact, or to detail his concerns with it.
</P>
<P>
Rhode Island has also wavered on signing the pact.
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday, after Romney held a press conference to announce an
emission plan for the state's dirtiest power plants, he indicated
that Massachusetts could join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative pact
if it incorporated a key piece of the state plan.
An e-mail message scheduled to go out to the other
states by Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Romney has raised concerns over the potential cost to businesses of
the multistate program. Last week, Romney suggested a price cap,
but not give details.
</P>
<P>
"Anytime you negotiate you have to make sure you let people
know that if you don't get things that are satisfactory,
you won't sign on," Romney said. "And so we will
have a negotiation."
</P>
<P>
The new state plan, which was announced Wednesday, would be the
first in the country to require power plants to limit
emissions of carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which takes effect next month, places a cap plants'
payments exceeding carbon dioxide levels the state sets for each
plant. The limits target the state's six oldest and most
power plants.
</P>
<P>
The Massachusetts plan places a limit on how much pollution each
plant could emit. Because those limits are lower than what
the plants currently emit, the owners would have to reduce
carbon dioxide or fund other carbon dioxide reductions elsewhere. For
example, companies could plant trees that absorb carbon dioxide, to
offset excess emissions.
</P>
<P>
Those investments would have to take place in the Northeast. If
the cost to a Massachusetts plant reaches $6.50 to offset
a ton of carbon dioxide emissions for 12 consecutive months,
the plant could shop for reductions worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists are critical of the plan, saying it will allow power
plants to pollute at a set price rather than lower
carbon dioxide emissions.
</P>
<P>
New York state officials, who first proposed the regional pact, said
they have not yet reviewed details of Romney's state plan.
But they indicated that if Romney's proposal is anything like
what he announced in the press conference Wednesday, it would
not reduce carbon dioxide emissions enough and would be rejected.
</P>
<P>
"Massachusetts has decided to pursue a ... plan that will impose
new taxes, but fail to ... reduce emissions," said Peter
Constantakes, an aide to Governor George S. Pataki, a Republican.
