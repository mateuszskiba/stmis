Oil companies Statoil ASA and Royal Dutch Shell PLC announced a joint project
Wednesday to cut pollution by using carbon dioxide from power plants to enhance
oil recovery.
</P>
<P>
The companies said they want to capture carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping,
greenhouse gas, from natural gas electricity production and inject it into
offshore fields so more oil can be recovered.
</P>
<P>
"The project consists of a gas-fired power plant and methanol production
facility at Tjeldbergodden in mid-Norway, providing CO2 to the Draugen and
Heidrun offshore oil and gas fields," the companies said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Statoil Chief Executive Helge Lund said the project was in
an early phase, and it was not clear when the companies would decide whether to
go ahead.
</P>
<P>
"There are many pieces that must fall into place before a decision to invest,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Norway is the world's third-largest oil exporter, after Saudi Arabia and Russia,
and also exports vast amounts of natural gas from its offshore
fields.
</P>
<P>
However, the Nordic country has traditionally produced most of its own
electricity from clean hydroelectric plants, and using natural gas generation at
home has met stiff opposition because it would increase pollution.
</P>
<P>
Statoil and Shell now want to develop a system for using natural gas to produce
power in Norway, scrub and capture the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and use it
to maintain pressure in offshore oil reservoirs, boosting crude
recovery.
</P>
<P>
The companies said the project would be the world's largest effort to use carbon
dioxide to enhance oil recovery, with up to 2.5 million tons (2.8 million U.S.
tons) of the gas injected into the fields per year.
</P>
<P>
That is roughly the emissions from 1 million automobiles, or about 5 percent of
Norway's total CO2 emissions.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important milestone for Shell towards our vision for greener fossil
fuels with part of the carbon dioxide captured and sequestrated underground,"
said Shell's Chief Executive Officer Jeroen van der Veer.
</P>
<P>
The project also calls for laying electricity cables from the land-based power
plant to the platform, further cutting pollution by reducing the need to burn
petroleum offshore to produce the electricity the installations
need.
</P>
<P>
Lund, of Statoil, said the project aims to meet several of the challenges facing
world society, including cutting pollution while increasing electricity and oil
supplies.
</P>
<P>
The project won immediate praise from environmental groups, which had adamantly
opposed construction of natural gas power plants in Norway.
</P>
<P>
"This is the best news I have had in a long time. We have worked for this for
years," said Frederic Hauge, leader of the Norwegian environmental group
Bellona.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Palm, a carbon dioxide expert with the Norwegian environmental group
Zero, said the project could increase oil recovery by at least 155 million
barrels in its lifetime.
