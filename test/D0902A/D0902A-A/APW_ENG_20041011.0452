Minister: Morning-after pil's distribution to go ahead in Peru,
despite opposition
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Peru's health minister said Monday that government plans to
distribute morning-after birth control pills at public health clinics
will begin as scheduled in January, despite an attempt by
conservative lawmakers in this predominantly Roman Catholic country
to have her prosecuted for promoting abortion.
</P>
<P>
"The decision is made and there is no turning back," Health Minister
Pilar Mazzetti told reporters. "This is not based on personal
beliefs, but in technical and scientific studies that show the pill
is not abortive."
</P>
<P>
Mazzetti said the pill, which contains the hormone levonorgestrel and
is sold in Lima pharmacies under the brand-name Postinor-2, prevents
pregnancy by inhibiting ovulation.
</P>
<P>
To be effective, it must be taken within 72 hours of intercourse.
</P>
<P>
Last week three conservative legislators denounced Mazzetti for
"lying" when she reported to Peru's Justice Ministry that the pills
are not a form of abortion because they cancel a pregnancy before the
fertilized egg implants itself in the uterus.
</P>
<P>
The legislators, who argued that life begins upon fertilization, want
Congress to vote on whether to lift Mazzetti's constitutional
immunity to face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
Abortion is illegal in Peru, except in cases where the mother's life
is in danger.
</P>
<P>
"Any time one assumes public office there is a risk," Mazzetti said.
"Evidently, in a democratic country, everyone has the liberty to make
denunciations and accusations and whatever. If this accusation is
presented, the Ministry of Health will have to back up its
decisions."
</P>
<P>
Peru's Medical Board has endorsed Mazzetti, and Rocio Villanueva,
Peru's deputy human rights ombudsman, said the criminal allegations
against Mazzetti "have no basis."
