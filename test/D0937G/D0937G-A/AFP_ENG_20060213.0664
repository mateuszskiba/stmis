<P>
The White House drew fire 
Monday for not immediately disclosing that Vice President Dick 
Cheney had shot a 78-year-old hunting partner in a weekend incident 
not reported until a day after it took place.
</P>
<P>
There was still no official account of the events on Katherine 
Armstrong's south-Texas ranch on Saturday, when Cheney missed his 
quail quarry but hit prominent lawyer Harry Whittington in the neck 
and chest with birdshot.
</P>
<P>
And Bush spokesman Scott McClellan battled criticism over the 
decision by Cheney's office to let Armstrong -- a private citizen 
with no official White House role -- make the news public by 
informing her local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"I think you can always look back at these issues and look at 
how to do a better job," mused McClellan, who said he had advocated 
full disclosure and left little doubt that he would have handled the 
situation differently.
</P>
<P>
Bush knew an hour after the fact that a hunting accident had 
taken place at 5:30 pm (2330 GMT), and it took him another 30 
minutes to find out that Cheney had pulled the trigger, said 
McClellan.
</P>
<P>
Breaking with precedent, the White House did not disclose the 
information to the national media that cover Bush and Cheney. The 
news first came to light on Sunday at 1:48 pm (1948 GMT), when the 
Corpus Christi Caller-Times published Armstrong's account on its 
Internet site.
</P>
<P>
Cheney and Armstrong "agreed that she should make that 
information public.  She was an eyewitness, she saw what occurred 
and she called her local paper to provide those facts," said 
McClellan.
</P>
<P>
Whittington was in stable condition in the intensive care unit 
at Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial, were he was treated for wounds 
to his shoulder, upper body, chest and neck, said hospital 
spokeswoman Michele Mora-Trevino.
</P>
<P>
Cheney aides continued to decline requests for an official 
timeline and details of the incident, pointing reporters to 
Armstrong's account and vouching for its accuracy.
</P>
<P>
McClellan as well as Cheney spokeswoman Lea Anne McBride 
insisted that the time gap between the incident and its confirmation 
by the White House was due to a focus on getting Whittington the 
medical care he needed.
</P>
<P>
McClellan also said that details about the shooting were 
trickling in throughout the night and that the White House needed 
"to get the facts together."
</P>
<P>
"It was an accident. Unfortunately, these types of hunting 
accidents do happen from time to time," the spokesman told a 
frequently contentious briefing with reporters.
</P>
<P>
Asked why getting Whittington medical attention was incompatible 
with releasing details of the incident, McClellan said that the vice 
president's office had "worked to get that information out."
</P>
<P>
But the Caller-Times reported Monday that McBride, after 
confirming the incident around noon (1800 GMT) on Sunday, had 
refused to say whether the vice president's office would have 
disclosed the incident if the daily had not contacted her after 
getting a tip from an unnamed Armstrong family member.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to speculate," the daily quoted her as saying. 
"When you put the call into me, I was able to confirm that 
account."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong has said that Whittington came up noiselessly behind 
the vice president, who spun around to target a bird and shot his 
fellow hunter instead.
</P>
<P>
The incident made the front pages of The Washington Post, The 
New York Times, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal, most of which 
noted soberly that Cheney's office had not gone public with the 
information when it happened.
</P>
<P>
Late-night talk show hosts, who typically mine such incidents 
for laughs, were not broadcasting over the weekend, making Monday 
night the first time they will be able to train their sights on the 
mishap.
