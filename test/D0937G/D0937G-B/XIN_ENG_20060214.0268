<P>
A Texas sheriff's office has 
cleared
U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney of any wrongdoing in a shooting 
accident at a ranch in the state Saturday, the USA Today newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cheney accidentally shot fellow hunter Harry Whittington while 
they were hunting quail at the Armstrong Ranch, in southern Texas.
The Kenedy County Sheriff's Office near the ranch interviewed both
men after the Secret Service called to notify them shortly after 
the shooting, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's office said investigation revealed that there was
no alcohol or misconduct involved in the incident, which "was no 
more than a hunting accident."
</P>
<P>
Cheney did violate one small legal requirement, the report 
said.
</P>
<P>
Cheney's office said Monday that while Cheney had a 125-U.S. 
dollar non-resident Texas hunting license, he lacked a required 
7-dollar stamp to hunt upland game birds such as quail. In a 
statement, his office said Cheney has mailed a 7-dollar check for 
the stamp.
</P>
<P>
The White House worked on Monday to explain why it took almost 
20 hours for the public to first learn of the accident.
</P>
<P>
"The first priority was making sure that Harry Whittington, Mr.
Whittington, was getting the medical care that he needed," White 
House spokesman Scott McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
President George W. Bush and White House deputy chief of staff 
Karl Rove were told of the shooting Saturday night but deferred to
Cheney on providing information to the public, a report in 
Tuesday's The Washington Post said.
</P>
<P>
The Post report said even some White House officials thought 
Cheney mishandled the responses and opened the administration to 
criticism that it was withholding important public information.
</P>
<P>
Whittington, 78, an Austin lawyer and longtime Republican 
activist, was in stable condition at Christus Spohn 
Hospital-Memorial in Corpus Christi, Texas, news reports said.
