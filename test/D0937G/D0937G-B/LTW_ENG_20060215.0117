Vice President Dick Cheney's public mea culpa
Wednesday did little to clear up significant questions surrounding the
accidental shooting, including why the White House sat on the story
for almost a full day and whether he received preferential treatment
from local deputies.
</P>
<P>
Here is a look at some of those questions:
</P>
<P>
Q. Why didn't the White House notify the public immediately
Saturday night that the vice president accidentally shot a man?
</P>
<P>
A. Cheney makes it clear that it was his decision to wait almost a
full day to go public. But he doesn't indicate why top Bush aides like
Karl Rove -- and even President Bush himself -- appear to have
deferred to him on it.
</P>
<P>
Q. Why didn't Cheney just put the word out Saturday night to avoid
risking charges coming from critics now of a cover-up?
</P>
<P>
A. Cheney said he waited overnight to find out how seriously victim
Harry Whittington was hurt and to avoid rushing out inaccurate
information.
</P>
<P>
Q. Did Rove, Bush chief of staff Andrew Card or even Bush himself
want Cheney to go public Saturday night?
</P>
<P>
A. Unknown. In one of the more striking statements from the
nation's No. 2 leader, Cheney says he didn't personally speak to
anyone at the White House until Sunday morning, despite having been
involved in the shooting accident the night before.
</P>
<P>
Rove told Bush at about 8 p.m. Saturday that Cheney was the shooter
-- roughly an hour after the shooting occurred.
</P>
<P>
Q. The White House has an elaborate media operation -- why did
Cheney bypass it and the national media outlets that cover the White
House around the clock?
</P>
<P>
A. Also unclear. Cheney said only that he had no spokesperson
traveling with him, even though his traveling staff can be in 24-7
contact with the White House. But Cheney has done little in his five
years in office to disguise his disdain for the national media.
</P>
<P>
Q. How did Cheney decide to alert the news media?
</P>
<P>
A. On Sunday, ranch owner Katharine Armstrong initially told CNN
that she tipped off the local newspaper without first talking to
Cheney. But by Monday, the White House said Cheney agreed with her
suggestion and told her to give the story to a reporter she knew at
the Corpus Christi Caller-Times.
</P>
<P>
Q. Why didn't the local sheriff's office talk to Cheney on the same
day as the shooting?
</P>
<P>
A. Kenedy County Sheriff Ramon Salinas III and the federal Secret
Service have given conflicting accounts.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Salinas told The New York Times that a deputy talked to
Cheney Saturday night. But CBS said the sheriff's office complained a
deputy had been turned away that evening.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Secret Service said its agents called Salinas soon
after the shooting and arranged for a Sunday morning meeting with
Cheney. Salinas said he decided not to send a deputy Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Q. Why didn't the sheriff charge Cheney in the shooting?
</P>
<P>
A. Salinas said he decided it was an accident Saturday after
talking to the Secret Service and a ranch hand he described as a
former deputy and Salinas' daughter's boyfriend. Salinas said Cheney
and Whittington also told deputies it was accidental. If Whittington
dies, however, the county prosecutor has said he might impanel a grand
jury to investigate.
</P>
<P>
Q. Whose fault was the shooting?
</P>
<P>
A. Cheney Wednesday took full responsibility for the shooting,
saying, ``You can't blame anybody else. I'm the guy who pulled the
trigger and shot my friend.'' But for three days, he let his friend
and hunting host, Armstrong, blame the victim, saying it was
Whittington's fault for not telling other members of the hunting party
he was nearby.
</P>
<P>
In the end, hunting experts say it's one of the cardinal rules of
hunting, that responsibility ultimately lies with the shooter. ``You
should know what you're shooting,'' said one veteran Texas hunting
guide.
