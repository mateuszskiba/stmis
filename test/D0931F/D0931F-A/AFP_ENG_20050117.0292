<P>
Pakistan on Monday denied reports in a 
US magazine that it was helping American special forces target 
suspected weapons sites for air strikes in neighbouring Iran.
</P>
<P>
"There is no such collaboration," foreign ministry spokesman 
Masood Khan said, referring to an article in the New Yorker magazine 
that claimed Pakistani scientists were providing the US with 
information on Iranian nuclear sites.
</P>
<P>
"We do not have much information about Iran's nuclear programme 
so I think this report is far-fetched and it exaggerates facts which 
do not exist in the first place," Khan told a weekly press briefing 
in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think there is any substance in what has been 
reported. I think this is pure conjecture."
</P>
<P>
The New Yorker said Pakistan was helping the US in return for 
guarantees that it will not have to hand over disgraced nuclear 
scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan to international authorities for 
questioning.
</P>
<P>
Khan, the architect of Pakistan's nuclear programme, in February 
took responsibility for transfers of nuclear technology to Iran, 
Libya and North Korea. He was pardoned by President Pervez 
Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
The magazine said Pakistani scientists were giving information 
to be used by US commandos searching for underground nuclear 
installations in eastern Iran.
