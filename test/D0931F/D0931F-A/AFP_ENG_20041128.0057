Investigators looking into illicit transfers of nuclear weapons
technology have recently uncovered a South African-based scheme to
deliver a complete uranium enrichment plant to Libya, The Los Angeles
Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Citing documents and interviews, the newspaper said the discovery
provided fresh evidence of the reach and sophistication of Pakistani
scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan's global black market in nuclear know-how
and equipment.
</P>
<P>
The dimensions of the plot began to emerge in September, when police
raided a factory outside Johannesburg, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
They found the elements of a two-story steel processing system for
the enrichment plant, packed in 11 freight containers for shipment to
Libya.
</P>
<P>
South African officials have disclosed only that they discovered
nuclear components, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
But The Times has learned that the massive system was designed to
operate an array of 1,000 centrifuges for enriching uranium.
</P>
<P>
Once assembled in Libya, the plant could have produced enough
weapons-grade uranium to manufacture several nuclear bombs a year,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Delivery of the plant would have greatly accelerated Libya's efforts
to develop nuclear weapons, The Times said.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of a South African connection to A.Q. Khan network has
led to the arrests of four business and engineering figures in South
Africa, including some who had been involved in the former apartheid
regime's nuclear program, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Khan, the disgraced architect of Pakistan's nuclear program, took
full responsibility in February for nuclear leaks to Iran, Libya and
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
Libya has since renounced its nuclear program and allowed the United
States to ship its key technological components out of the country.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which was close to testing a nuclear device in the late
1970s, has abandoned its nuclear program following the collapse of
the apartheid regime.
