Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf on Sunday
defended his decision not to allow international investigators to
interrogate A.Q. Khan, the rogue Pakistani scientist accused of
peddling nuclear secrets around the world.
</P>
<P>
Appearing offended, Musharraf said the requests from U.N. nuclear
inspectors indicated a lack of trust in Pakistan. In a CNN interview,
he portrayed the issue as a matter of national pride.
</P>
<P>
President Bush met with Musharraf on Saturday and urged the
Pakistani general to make sure that all possible information about
nuclear proliferation by the Khan network be turned over to the
Americans. Musharraf promised to do so.
</P>
<P>
But the White House did not ask for direct access to Khan --
apparently in deference to Pakistani sensitivities about a man who, as
the father of the Pakistani atomic bomb, had been considered a hero.
However, the International Atomic Energy Agency still wants to
interview Khan, who has been pardoned by Musharraf, as well as his
assistant, who is being held in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Lacking such cooperation, officials deem it unlikely that Khan's
activities will ever be fully unraveled, the Los Angeles Times
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the CNN interview Sunday, Musharraf insisted that Pakistan could
do the best job interrogating Khan.
</P>
<P>
``It shows a lack of trust in us,'' Musharraf complained. ``We can
question him the best, and then there is ... a domestic sensitivity.
This man is a hero for the Pakistanis and there is a sensitivity that
maybe the world wants to intervene in our nuclear program, which
nobody wants. ...
</P>
<P>
''It is a pride of the nation,`` he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have raised doubts about whether Musharraf is keeping Khan
from speaking to international investigators for fear the scientist
might reveal the extent to which some of his activities may have been
condoned by the Pakistani military.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf denied ''200 percent`` that any Pakistani government or
the military had any knowledge that Khan was making nuclear weapons
information available to other nations.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to the United States, the Pakistani leader, a key
Bush administration ally in the war on terrorism, also said that in
hindsight, the U.S. decision to invade Iraq was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
''We have landed ourselves in more trouble,`` he told CNN's ''Late
Edition.``
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said he had no idea where Osama bin Laden was hiding but
suggested that al-Qaida's command structure in Pakistan has been
broken by recent military operations aimed at rousting terrorist
forces from tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
In Pakistan, pro-government and opposition parties staged large
street demonstrations to coincide with Musharraf's foreign tour.
</P>
<P>
In the central city of Multan, the main opposition Islamic alliance
held a rally and vowed to force Musharraf to quit as army chief if he
reneged on his promise to do so voluntarily by year's end, the Reuters
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Loosening the military's control over politics has been a key goal
of the Pakistani democracy movement, but the parliament recently
passed a law that would allow Musharraf to continue to hold the top
army job and the presidency.
