Pakistan's nuclear assets are 
under foolproof security parameters and their safety can be surely
guaranteed, said Pakistani foreign office spokesman Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"All the allegations raised against Pakistan by the Time 
Magazine report are baseless and unfounded," Masood Ahmed Khan 
said at a PTV program.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan had established Command and Control Authority,
Strategic Plan Division and Strategic Forces bringing everything 
into a parameter of reliable intelligence mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Pakistan had been in constant contact with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its role in breaking
the international nuclear black market was acknowledged and 
appreciated by the world community.
</P>
<P>
"There is no chance of the transfer of nuclear information or 
technology from Pakistan to any other country," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the investigation into Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan, 
Masood said Pakistan had thoroughly investigated the case against 
Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan and his associates, and proper security 
measures had been taken on the basis of results obtained through 
investigation.
</P>
<P>
He said further investigation in this regard could be made only
when there was solid evidence. Rumors and speculations cannot be 
taken into account in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The latest edition of the US-based Time Magazine alleged that 
the nuclear international black market of Qadir Khan is still 
operational.
