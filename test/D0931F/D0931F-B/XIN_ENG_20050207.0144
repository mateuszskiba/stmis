Pakistan Monday dismissed as "
incorrect and unrealistic" a US Time magazine report that the 
United States is investigating whether the father of Pakistan's 
nuclear bomb sold nuclear technologies to Saudi Arabia and other 
countries.
</P>
<P>
Time magazine in its latest edition also claimed that Pakistan'
s Abdul Qadeer Khan network of suppliers and middlemen is still 
operational.
</P>
<P>
"The Time has distorted the facts and made them sensationalize.
There is no reality in the report and it is not based on facts," 
Information Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed told Geo television.
</P>
<P>
He said Qadeer Khan has admitted to provide information to 
three countries but the Time story about selling technologies to 
Saudi Arabia or other Arab countries is incorrect.
</P>
<P>
Rashid also rejected the magazine's claim that some cylinders 
have disappeared from Kahuta Research Laboratories (LRL), the 
country's major nuclear facility.
</P>
<P>
"We have checked all the record and no cylinder is missing from
the KRL. We are ready to remove apprehensions if there are any," 
Rashid said.
</P>
<P>
Time magazine quoted sources as confirming that the United 
States has submitted questions to Qadeer Khan on whether the 
countries he allegedly provided nuclear secrets have sold such 
equipment to third parties.
</P>
<P>
"We have solved Dr Qadeer Khan's issue and he will not be 
handed over to any country," Rashid said. He said there is no 
pressure on Pakistan on the issue and Pakistan is in touch with 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
</P>
<P>
At a weekly news briefing, Foreign Office spokesman Masood Khan
also categorically denied the magazine's story, saying the report 
is "highly speculated."
</P>
<P>
He added that Pakistan is still fully investigating the Qadeer 
Khan case and shares the results with the United States and the 
European countries. "We have not closed the investigation," the 
spokesman said.
