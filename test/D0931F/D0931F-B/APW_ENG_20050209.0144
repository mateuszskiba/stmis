Pakistan said Wednesday the case of disgraced nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan was
still open but it has received no new evidence to suggest that his black market
network had sold technology to more countries than earlier thought.
</P>
<P>
Last February, President Gen. Pervez Musharraf pardoned Khan after he confessed
to supplying sensitive technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea. But this week
Time magazine reported that U.S. officials were also investigating whether the
scientist's network might have supplied Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries,
such as Egypt.

<P>
On Wednesday, Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Masood Khan said A.Q. Khan's
"case is still open."
</P>
<P>
"We will quiz any of our scientists if somebody comes up with evidence to prove
his links with the proliferators of nuclear technology," the spokesman told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
But he said the government had "received no new evidence from any country,
individual or organization, including IAEA" _ referring to the U.N. nuclear
watchdog, the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
A.Q. Khan, who was once regarded as a national hero for his role in making
Pakistan a nuclear power, has lived under virtual house arrest in Islamabad for
the past year.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Pakistan denied that Khan's network was still operating and denied a
specific allegation in Time magazine's report that 16 cylinders of uranium
hexafluoride gas _ a critical ingredient for uranium enrichment for weapons _
had gone missing from Pakistan's main nuclear lab, the Khan Research
Laboratories, named after the scientist.
</P>
<P>
"As far as we are concerned, we have fulfilled our responsibility by dismantling
this network from Pakistan, and we are quite vigilant and alert now," the
Foreign Ministry spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Pakistan would not allow any country, individual or even the
IAEA to interrogate its scientists. "We are a responsible nuclear state, and we
have full confidence in our investigations system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan denies there was any official involvement in Khan's illegal nuclear
trading, which earned the scientist a fortune.
