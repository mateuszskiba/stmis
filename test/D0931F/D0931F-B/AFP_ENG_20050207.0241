<P>
Pakistan Monday rejected a report that 
disgraced nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan sold equipment to 
Saudi Arabia but said its probe into a proliferation scandal centred 
on him was not over.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials said Islamabad would look into any fresh 
evidence if it emerged but described the article in US weekly Time 
as baseless and a rehash of previous reports.
</P>
<P>
"This is not correct," foreign ministry spokesman Masood Khan 
told reporters at a weekly briefing when asked if Khan, the father 
of Pakistan's atomic programme, had sold technology to fellow Muslim 
nation Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
"The allegation has been made several times in the past, but 
this is part of a disinformation campaign. It is baseless (and) does 
not have any substance," he added.
</P>
<P>
"It is a rehash of several speculative stories which have 
appeared in the media in the recent past."
</P>
<P>
Abdul Qadeer Khan has been under effective house arrest since he 
appeared on Pakistan state television in February 2004 and took full 
responsibility for passing nuclear technology to Iran, Libya and 
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf gave him a conditional 
pardon and has said that no government or military body was involved 
in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
But the military leader has steadfastly refused to allow the US 
or the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) to interrogate 
Khan.
</P>
<P>
Time magazine, citing a source in Pakistan's defense ministry, 
said Khan had also played a bigger role in helping Ir without facts".
</P>
<P>
The minister and the spokesman both denied claims that 16 
cylinders of uranium hexafluoride gas used for uranium enrichment 
were missing from the country's main enrichment facility, Khan 
Research Laboratories (KRL).
</P>
<P>
"Our inventory is complete and nothing is missing from KRL," 
Rashid said.
