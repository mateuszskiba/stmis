Pakistan will not let any foreigners 
question Abdul Qadeer Khan, the father of the country's nuclear bomb 
who has admitted leaking secrets to states including North Korea, 
Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have refused direct interrogations by anyone. The reason is 
national sensitivity," Kasuri told a press conference at the end of 
a three-day visit to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Kasuri said Pakistan had acted against Khan even though the 
Pakistani opposition had accused the government of "succumbing to 
international pressure" against the local hero.
</P>
<P>
"Actions have been taken (against Khan) and they are very 
strict. We are prepared... to investigate and share information," 
Kasuri said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that Khan, who os effectively under house arrest, had 
interacted with foreigners when he leaked informaton of the 
country's nuclear technology.
</P>
<P>
"In fact there were some foreigners involved. Pakistan has taken 
actions. Other foreigners, we hope actions will be taken against 
them by their governments," Kasuri said.
</P>
<P>
Khan, who is credited with making Pakistan a nuclear power, 
confessed in February 2004 to leaking nuclear know-how to Iran, 
Libya and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
Khan was later pardoned by President Pervez Musharraf, who has 
repeatedly refused to allow the United States or the International 
Atomic Energy Agency to question him.
</P>
<P>
"We have shared information with the International Atomic Energy 
Agency," Kasuri said.
</P>
<P>
"We have shared all information we had on any issue relevant to 
this (Khan) with the United States and friendly countries, 
definitely with the government of Japan," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If there are new leads, we will investigate those," he added.
</P>
<P>
Japan is locked in a standoff with North Korea over the 
Stalinist state's kidnapping of Japanese citizens. Pyongyang fired a 
missile over Japan into the Pacific Ocean in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"We are sensitive to Japanese concerns. We will share any 
information we have relevant to your security," Kasuri said.
