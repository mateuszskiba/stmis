A Tamil Tiger member was killed by unidentified gunmen on Wednesday
night in eastern Sri Lanka, the police said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The victim, Maheswaran Rusangan, was shot dead as he returned to his
home in the eastern town of Valaichchenai, 280 kilometers from the
capital Colombo, said the police.

<P>
The pro-rebel Website TamilNet said Rusangan, a political worker of
the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), was shot dead by
gunmen "suspected to be paramilitary operatives working with the Sri
Lanka military intelligence".
</P>
<P>
There has been sporadic fighting in the eastern region since former
top rebel commander Karuna split from the mainstream LTTE in March,
taking with him some 6,000 fighters. Karuna went underground one
month later.
</P>
<P>
The internal conflict of the LTTE has hampered the Norwegian
facilitators' efforts to try to revive the stalled peace talks in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels walked out of the peace talks in April last year
after six rounds, which commenced in September 2002, seven months
after the cease-fire between the government and the LTTE.
