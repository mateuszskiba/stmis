Sri Lanka's government Friday accused Tamil Tiger guerrillas of
breaking a Norwegian-arranged ceasefire by killing a government
soldier and a military informant.
</P>
<P>
The government said in a statement that Thursday's killing of a
soldier from the military intelligence unit and an informant had all
the "hallmarks" of the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
"This is a direct violation of the ceasefire agreement which calls on
the parties not to engage in assassinations," the statement said.
"The continuing violations cast doubts on the seriousness of the
commitment of the LTTE."
</P>
<P>
The statement said it also raised doubts about the LTTE's interest in
observing the Norwegian-led peace initiative aimed at ending three
decades of ethnic bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified gunmen shot dead the two men in the island's east
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The attackers opened fire as the victims rode a motorcycle in the
district of Polonnaruwa, the officials said, adding that
investigations were under way to track down the killers.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The military has blamed similar attacks on the Tamil Tigers.
</P>
<P>
The government has accused the Tigers of killing more than 250
rivals, including military informants, since the Norwegian-brokered
ceasefire went into effect from February 23, 2002.
