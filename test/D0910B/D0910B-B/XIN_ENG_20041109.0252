A Norwegian peace envoy arrived in Colombo on Tuesday to revive Sri
Lanka's stalled peace process as the Tamil rebels' chief negotiator
returned from London to join the talks, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian special envoy Erik Solheim has held talks with Rauf Hakeem,
leader of the country's main Muslim party Sri Lanka Muslim Congress,
one day before Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen's scheduled
visit to the country on Wednesday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Sri Lanka's rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) chief negotiator Anton Balasingham arrived in rebel- held
northern town of Kilinochchi on Tuesday, the pro-rebel TamilNet said.
</P>
<P>
Balasingham will consult with the Tamil Tiger supremo Velupillai
Prabhakaran regarding the current state of the peace process in Sri
Lanka, LTTE officials said.
</P>
<P>
The objective of Balasingham's coming back to Sri Lanka is to assist
the LTTE leader in talks with Norwegian foreign minister Jan
Peterson, who will be here to push for a fresh attempt to revive the
tottering peace talks between the government and the Tamil Tigers
rebel.
</P>
<P>
LTTE political wing leader S.P. Thamilselvan said Saturday that it is
ready to resume peace talks with the government if its self- rule
proposal gets a positive response.
</P>
<P>
However, Petersen has said earlier that he is not coming to Sri Lanka
with "high expectations."
</P>
<P>
"Based on signals from the parties over recent weeks, I do not have
high expectation, but in difficult situations it is even more
important to keep engaging with the parties," the Norwegian Embassy
in Sri Lanka quoted Petersen as saying.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels had been fighting against government forces to set up
an independent Tamil homeland in the north and east since 1983 until
they entered into a Norwegian-brokered ceasefire in February 2002.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the government and the Tamil Tiger rebels
have been on hold since April last year when the rebels walked out
after six rounds of direct negotiations owing to LTTE's adherence to
their self-rule proposal.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian facilitators have been trying to revive the stalled
peace talks since May this year but their efforts have been futile so
far.
