Japanese envoy Yasushi Akashi has wrapped up talks with Sri Lankan
government figures but is waiting to meet Tamil Tiger leaders in an
effort to help salvage the island's peace process, officials said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Akashi who arrived late Wednesday, was due to travel to the
rebel-held north Sunday but had to put off his plans because the main
guerrilla political wing leader, S.P. Thamilselvan, was still abroad,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said Akashi was hopeful of meeting with the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) leadership before leaving the island on Tuesday as
officials said they expected Thamilselvan to return from Europe by
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Akashi met President Chandrika Kumaratunga Friday, a day after seeing
Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse and opposition political leaders
from the Sri Lankan parliament.
</P>
<P>
"The president described to Mr. Akashi the recent developments in the
peace process and the importance of beginning direct peace talks
between the government and the LTTE as soon as possible,"
Kumaratunga's office said.
</P>
<P>
It said in a statement that Kumaratunga thanked Japan for its
"generous assistance and support" to Sri Lanka's economic development
and the consolidation of peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Japan is Sri Lanka's largest single donor of aid and in recent years
has taken a hands-on approach to support the Norwegian-backed process
aimed at ending three decades of ethnic bloodshed that has claimed
60,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Akashi's latest mission came as Tamil Tigers said they had not
abandoned their right to secede despite agreeing to explore a federal
solution during talks with Colombo in December 2002.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said Akashi could broach the subject with the LTTE
leadership when he meets them.
</P>
<P>
The Tigers suspended their participation in direct negotiations in
April last year describing six rounds of talks with the government as
a "waste of time".
</P>
<P>
The LTTE insists that talks can resume based only on a proposal for
an Interim Self-Governing Authority envisaging regional autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The peace process is officially blocked over differences on an agenda
to restart talks, but diplomats engaged in the initiative say a
serious split among the Tamil Tigers could be the real reason.
