More policemen are being deployed in Sri Lankan capital Colombo
following increasing violence reportedly having connection with
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels, official sources said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Security measures in key street junctions have been tightened with
more roadblocks set up by heavily armed men in the capital of the
island country.
</P>
<P>
"It is a preventive action," said Sirisena Herath, deputy inspector
general of police for Colombo.
</P>
<P>
A Tamil businessman belonging to a rival Tamil group that supports a
united Sri Lanka was shot dead late Thursday when he was drinking tea
at a hotel in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Velayutham Dayalakumar, 44, was shot several times at close range and
died on the spot. His companion, whose name was not released,
sustained injuries, police said.
</P>
<P>
Dayalakumar was a member of the Peoples Liberation Organization of
Tamil Eelam (PLOTE). Formerly a Tamil separatist group, the PLOTE
gave up violence in 1989 and joined Sri Lanka's political mainstream.
It continues to support Tamil rights, but within a united Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the office of a rival Tamil political party was raid
Thursday evening. Military sources said a suspected LTTE member
hurled a hand grenade at the office of the Eelam People's Democratic
Party (EPDP) in the country's eastern town of Chenkaladi while a EPDP
supporter was inside. The office was damaged, but no injuries were
reported.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE blame the violence on elements who want to discredit them
although the victims are members of breakaway rebel factions.
</P>
<P>
The heightened security comes just days before a visit by Norwegian
Foreign Minister Jan Petersen, who is due next week to revive the
country's peace process.
</P>
<P>
Petersen is scheduled to meet Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran,
who lives in hiding and is rarely seen in public.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government and the LTTE are deadlocked over the
later's central demand for interim self-rule in the war-torn north
and east.
