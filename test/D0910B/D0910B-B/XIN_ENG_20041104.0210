<P>
Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen will visit Sri Lanka from
Nov. 10 to 12, the Norwegian Embassy in Sri Lanka said Thursday in a
press release.
</P>
<P>
Petersen will meet Sri Lankan President Chandrika Bandaranaike
Kumaratunga and other government officials as well as leaders of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The objective of his visit is to maintain close contacts between the
facilitator and concerned parties in a bid to take the peace process
forward, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels and the government entered the ceasefire in February
2002 and started face to face negotiations seven months later but the
rebels walked out the talks last April.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian facilitators have been trying to revive the stalled
peace talks since May this year but their efforts have so far been
futile.
