A special peace envoy from Japan left here Monday morning for Sri
Lanka's rebel-held north to facilitate peace talks in the country,
said official sources.
</P>
<P>
Yasushi Akashi, who arrived here last Wednesday, is to hold talks
with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) political leadership
on its stalled peace talks with the Sri Lankan government.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE's political wing leader S.P. Thamilselvan, returning from a
month-long European tour early Monday, was flown to the northern
Kilinochchi district on board a Sri Lanka air force helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Akashi, who was appointed by the Japanese government two years ago to
underline the international community's support toward the resolution
of Sri Lanka's ethnic strife, is on a week-long tour to expedite the
resumption of talks.
</P>
<P>
He has held talks with the Sri Lankan President, Prime Minister and
other senior political party leaders in the last few days.
</P>
<P>
Efforts by the Norwegian peace facilitators to restart the process
stalled since April 2003 have been of no avail so far.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government and the LTTE held six rounds of direct
negotiations between September 2002 and April 2003.
