Sri Lankan Tamil Tiger rebels on Tuesday denied their killing of a
Swiss national in the eastern Batticaloa town and accused a media
report of discrediting the rebel group by concocting the story.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly dismiss this allegation which is based on speculation
and concoction of a story to discredit the LTTE ( Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam)," a rebel statement said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels said that Acting Head of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission
Hagrup Haukland has informed them that the preliminary investigation
conducted by the truce monitors indicated that "this is an individual
criminal act which has no connection whatsoever with the LTTE."

<P>
A 61-year-old Swiss national named Hans Ulrich was killed Monday
night by a hand grenade thrown into his toilet in Batticaloa town.
</P>
<P>
A media report has said that the killing was carried out by the LTTE
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The east of the country has been a scene of continuous internecine
clashes between the main LTTE rebel group in the north and their
renegade eastern commander known as Karuna.
</P>
<P>
Karuna split from the main rebel group with his 6,000 fighters in
March this year, but he went underground one month later when his
fighting squad was crushed by the mainstream faction.
