Internecine clashes between Sri Lankan Tamil Tiger rebels' rival
factions continued in the east and one of the members of the
mainstream rebel group has been killed, defense officials said on
Thursday.

<P>
Dharmalingam Thyagalingam, a 37-year-old loyalist of the mainstream
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) faction was killed Wednesday
night at Welikanda area in the east by members loyal to the renegade
rebel eastern commander known as Karuna.
</P>
<P>
His killing came after Tuesday's killings of two Muslims by
mainstream rebel members for supporting Karuna.
</P>
<P>
Internecine killings have become a feature mainly in the east of the
country ever since Karuna broke ranks with the LTTE in March this
year.
</P>
<P>
He challenged the leadership of the Tiger supremo Velupillai
Prabhakaran and blamed the LTTE leader for alleged favoritism of
northern members over the eastern ones.
</P>
<P>
The clashes have spilled into the Norwegian-backed peace process to
end the country's two decades of ethnic conflict.
</P>
<P>
The peace process stalled since April 2003 is yet to be revived as
internecine clashes have stood in the way among other issues.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE mainstream group accuses the military of providing cover to
Karuna but the charges have been denied by the government.
