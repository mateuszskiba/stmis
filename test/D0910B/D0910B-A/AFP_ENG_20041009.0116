Sri Lanka's elite police commandos Saturday shot dead a renegade
Tamil rebel who killed a regional commander from the main guerrilla
group, an official said.
</P>
<P>
The breakaway faction of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
shot dead a local commander known as Jude in the eastern Akkaraipattu
region and minutes after commandos gunned down the assassin, police
Special Task Force  chief Nimal Leuke said.
</P>
<P>
The man killed by the commandos belonged to the breakaway faction of
renegade commander V. Muralitharan, better known as Karuna, who went
underground in April after leading an unprecedented split in March.
</P>
<P>
"We've been accused of siding with Karuna's group, but what we have
shown that all we are interested is in maintaining law and order in
areas where we are present," Leuke said.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats involved in Sri Lanka's stalled peace process have said the
factional fighting was holding up efforts to revive direct
negotiations between Colombo and the main rebel outfit.
</P>
<P>
The government here has accused the Tigers of killing over 250 of
their political rivals since a truce arranged by peacebroker Norway
went into effect in February 2002.
</P>
<P>
More than 60,000 people have been killed in Sri Lanka's separatist
campaign led by the LTTE which was established in 1972.
