<P>
Sri Lankan government has finalised a set of counter proposals to the
Interim Self Governing Authority (ISGA) proposal put forward by the
Tamil Tiger rebles, the government spokesman said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mangala Samaraweera, the Minister of Information and Ports, said
"counter proposals are ready and waiting," adding that the government
was looking forward to the revival of direct negotiations with
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels.
</P>
<P>
Samaraweera stressted "we are baffled by the LTTE's delay in starting
negotiations" referring to the current hiatus in the
Norwegian-brokered peace process.
</P>
<P>
The ISGA proposals, also LTTE's interim power sharing blueprint,
which was presented in October last year, were heavily criticised by
Samaraweera's party then in opposition.
</P>
<P>
The new government after gaining power in April has been reluctant to
start talks on the ISGA while the LTTE rebels have insisted that
their ISGA proposals should be basis for the resumption of the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the government and the LTTE rebels have been
on hold since April last year when the rebels walked out following
six rounds of direct negotiations under the Wickremesinghe regime.
