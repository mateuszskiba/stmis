<P>
Sri Lanka's top Tamil Tiger rebel group on Friday began a week-long
meeting in Switzerland which is meant to prepare for the next round
of peace talks with the Sri Lankan government, the Swiss foreign
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Swiss officials met the chief negotiator of the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE), Anton Balasingham and other rebel officials on
the sidelines of the meeting of the LTTE's Consitutional Affairs
Committee in Geneva, which is due to end on October 7.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss foreign ministry said in a statement that it "welcomes the
LTTE's continuing willingness to negotiate, and calls for peace talks
to be resumed as soon as possible".
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has blamed the government of President Chandrika Kumaratunga
for the delay in reviving negotiations which the rebels themselves
suspended in April last year.
</P>
<P>
But Kumaratunga said last month that the Tigers were holding up talks
aimed at ending a conflict that has claimed more than 60,000 lives
since 1972.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil Tigers were reportedly undertaking a three-week tour of
Denmark, Ireland, Switzerland and Sri Lanka's peace broker Norway to
persuade donors to use aid as a tool to pressure the government to
resume peace talks based on rebel self-rule proposals.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss foreign ministry said "a possible interim administration of
the north east of Sri Lanka as decided in the peace talks should be
based on a federal structure within a united Sri Lanka" and backed
Norway's role as facilitator.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland has a large community of Sri Lankan Tamil emigrants, and
the country's decentralised federal political system has been cited
as a potential model for the Indian Ocean island.
