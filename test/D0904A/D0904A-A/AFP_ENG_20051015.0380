Rioting erupted Saturday in an 
impoverished neighborhood of Toledo, Ohio after hundreds of 
counter-protestors broke up a planned march by a neo-Nazi group, 
Toledo police confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Scores of rioters rampaged through streets wrecking cars and 
setting a building on fire in north Toledo after police fired tear 
gas on the anti-Nazi group.
</P>
<P>
Six people were arrested, according to Fox News.
</P>
<P>
The violence broke out after a group of nearly 80 white 
supremacists of the Virigina-based National Socialist Movement 
assembled for a march against what they called black gang violence 
against whites in the Toledo neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Bob White, leader of the movement, said police forced his group 
to disband after the protestors gathered around them and began to 
throw stones.
</P>
<P>
"The police lost total control of the situation," he told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"We were protesting black racial violence against white people 
in that neighborhood," said White.
</P>
<P>
But a local politician said that the multi-ethnic neighborhood 
was not particularly beset by violence.
</P>
<P>
"That neighborhood has never been known for racial tensions," 
city councilman Robert McCloskey told Fox.
