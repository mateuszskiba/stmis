A Jewish Defense League activist who was killed in a federal prison had received
death threats because of his militancy and needed more protection by
authorities, his former attorney said.
</P>
<P>
Earl Krugel, 62, was killed Friday evening at the Federal Correctional
Institution in Phoenix, where he was imprisoned for his role in a bomb plot
against a Southern California mosque and the office of a Lebanese-American
congressman.
</P>
<P>
Attorney Mark Werksman questioned why Krugel was transferred to the
medium-security prison last week. He had been in protective custody at Los
Angeles' federal Metropolitan Detention Center in recent years, Werksman
said.
</P>
<P>
"There were death threats against him precisely because he was a militant Jewish
activist," Werksman said Sunday. "So he always had to be watched and be guarded
in federal custody in L.A."
</P>
<P>
Werksman couldn't recall details of the threats, but he said Krugel might have
been targeted by white supremacists or Muslim extremists in the
past.
</P>
<P>
FBI Special Agent Richard Murray said a homicide probe was under way but
wouldn't confirm whether officials suspected white supremacists or other
inmates. Prison officials referred all calls to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
Family members said Krugel had been at the Arizona prison for three days and
died after an inmate struck him in the head with a concrete block.
</P>
<P>
Krugel, a former dental assistant from Los Angeles, was arrested in 2001 and
charged with conspiring to bomb the King Fahd Mosque in Culver City and a field
office of Republican Rep. Darrell E. Issa.
</P>
<P>
He pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in 2003, and was sentenced in September
to 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
JDL leader Irv Rubin, who was also convicted in the case, slashed his neck and
fell from a railing at the Los Angeles federal detention center exactly three
years to the day before Krugel's death. Rubin died nine days later; his death
was ruled a suicide.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish Defense League was founded in 1968 by Rabbi Meir Kahane. Kahane
advocated the forcible removal of Arabs from Israel. He was assassinated in 1990
in New York.
