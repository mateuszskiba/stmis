WILMINGTON, North Carolina

<P>
Race riots that led to the overthrow of this city's government in 1898 was
actually an insurrection that white supremacists had planned for months to strip
black residents of their rights, a state commission concluded.
</P>
<P>
The violence in Wilmington, which resulted in the deaths of at least 22 blacks
people, "was part of a statewide effort to put white supremacist Democrats in
office and stem the political advances of black citizens," the 1898 Wilmington
Riot Commission concludes in a draft report.
</P>
<P>
Afterward, white supremacists in state office passed laws that disfranchised
blacks until the civil rights movement and Voting Rights Act of the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, it crippled a segment of our population that hasn't recovered in
107 years," said Harper Peterson, a commission member and former mayor of
Wilmington. "It's a major event that went unnoticed."
</P>
<P>
At the time of the violence, black men in North Carolina had been able to vote
for some three decades as part of Reconstruction following the Civil War, said
Jeffrey Crow, deputy secretary of the state Office of Archives and History,
which researched the report.
</P>
<P>
The United States abolished slavery in 1865.
</P>
<P>
But within a year of the insurrection, the General Assembly was controlled by
Democrats and had passed the first segregation law that ended voting rights to
blacks.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly established the commission in 2000. Its draft report was
opened for public comment last week.
</P>
<P>
Some commission members have suggested financing historical exhibitions about
the riot and its consequences, portraying it in school history texts and
developing economic interests in affected areas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the state should issue some sort of apology for its inaction, said
Irving Joyner, vice chairman of the commission and a law professor at North
Carolina Central University.
