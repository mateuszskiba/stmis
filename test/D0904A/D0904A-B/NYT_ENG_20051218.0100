CITY CONFRONTS PAINFUL PAST IN REPORT ON RACE RIOTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WILMINGTON, N.C.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beneath canopies of moss-draped oaks, on sleepy streets
graced by antebellum mansions, tour guides here spin stories of
Cape Fear pirates and Civil War blockade runners for eager
tourists.
</P>
<P>
Only scant mention is made, however, of the bloody rioting more
than a century ago during which black residents were killed
and survivors banished by white supremacists, who seized control of
the city government in what historians say is the only
successful overthrow of a local government in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
But last week, Wilmington revisited that painful history with the release
of a draft of a 500-page report ordered by the
state legislature that not only tells the story of the
Nov. 10, 1898, upheaval, but also presents a detailed analysis
of its effects on black families that persist to this
day.
</P>
<P>
Culled from newspaper clippings, government records, historical archives and interviews, some
previously unexplored, the report explodes oft-repeated local claims that the
insurrection was a frantic response to a corrupt and ineffective
post-Reconstruction government.
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate goal was the resurgence of white rule of the
city and state for a handful of men through whatever
means necessary," the historian LeRae Umfleet wrote in the report's
introduction.
</P>
<P>
The report concludes that the rioting and coup fully ended black
participation in local government until the civil rights era, and
was a catalyst for the development of Jim Crow laws
in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
"Because Wilmington rioters were able to murder blacks in daylight and
overthrow Republican government without penalty or federal intervention, everyone in
the state, regardless of race, knew that the white supremacy
campaign was victorious on all fronts," the report said.
</P>
<P>
In the period immediately after the Civil War, the Democratic Party-ruled
government in Wilmington, which was then North Carolina's largest city,
was displaced by a coalition that was largely Republican and
included many blacks. The loss of power stirred dissatisfaction among
a faction of white civic leaders and business owners.
</P>
<P>
The tensions came to a head on Election Day, Nov. 9,
1898, when the Democrats regained power, according to historians, largely
by stuffing ballot boxes and intimidating black voters to keep
them from the polls. Not waiting for an orderly transition
of government, a group of white vigilantes demanded that power
be handed over immediately. When they were rebuffed, in the
words of the report, "Hell jolted loose."
</P>
<P>
The mob -- which the report said grew to as many
as 2,000 -- forced black leaders out of town, dismantled
the printing press of a black-owned newspaper, The Daily Record,
fired into the homes of blacks and shot down black
men in the streets.
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the number of black deaths are as high as
100, state officials said, although they add that there is
no way of truly knowing.
</P>
<P>
"No official count of dead can be ascertained due to a
paucity of records from the coroner's office, hospital or churches,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Black women and children fled to swamps on the city's outskirts
made frigid by November's chill. There are accounts of pregnant
women giving birth in the swamps, the babies dying soon
after.
</P>
<P>
No white deaths were verified.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, members of the North Carolina General Assembly commissioned
a report on the incident that they said would be
made part of the state's official record. The final report
is to be presented to lawmakers next year.
</P>
<P>
The release of the draft report -- and its painful conclusions
-- has been politely, if uncomfortably, received in this city.
</P>
<P>
"I spend a lot of time looking forward and not a
lot of time looking in the rearview mirror," said Mayor
Spence Broadhurst. "But we can use our history to grow
on. It was a horrible situation in 1898, and this
is 2005. But I think it is good for us
to talk about it and to fully understand it."
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
Styled after similar efforts to document racial atrocities in Rosewood, Fla.,
and in Tulsa, Okla., the report begins with a thorough
account of Wilmington's status as the Confederacy's premier port, and
the complex structure of its black society, which included slaves
as well as a sizable population of free black craftsmen
before Emancipation. Rifts between black tradesmen and white Democrats in
the years after Reconstruction are chronicled, along with the growth
of black society in prominence and power.
</P>
<P>
In 1897, a year before the race riot, black residents numbered
3,478, according to a directory for that year. By 1900
that number had fallen to 2,497, according to data in
the report.
</P>
<P>
According to the 2000 census, Wilmington had a population of 76,000.
Nearly 71 percent of its residents were white, and 26
percent were black.
</P>
<P>
Federal and state authorities did nothing in response to the racial
rioting in Wilmington, and according to the report, the revolt
became a model of sorts when violence later erupted in
other cities.
</P>
<P>
A 1906 upheaval in Atlanta, the report said, "suggests that the
lack of governmental response to the violence in Wilmington gave
Southerners implicit license to suppress the black community under the
right circumstances."
</P>
<P>
In the years after the Wilmington rebellion, blacks and whites alike
tended not to speak of it.
</P>
<P>
"I did not even know it happened until I was a
grandmother," said Lottie Clinton, 68, a lifelong resident of Wilmington
and a member of the Riot Commission. "My family thought
the more positive things I learned, the better off I
would be."
</P>
<P>
Another commission member, Anthony Gentile, a Wilmington contractor, said he had
questions initially about whether the report should have been done
at all.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to keep open wounds open," Gentile said. "There
were a lot of emotions, and there was a lot
of animosity. I was not in favor of doing it."
</P>
<P>
He continued, "Everyone made mistakes 100 years ago; let's deal with
today."
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "My opinion changed, and I was surprised to
learn the depth of feeling that existed and that it
was not that long ago."
