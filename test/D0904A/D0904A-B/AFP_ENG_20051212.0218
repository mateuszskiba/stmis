Australian police brace for new race riots, PM calls for calm
ATTENTION - RECASTS with fears of more violence ///

SYDNEY, Dec 12
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard 
appealed for calm while airborne and mounted police reinforcements 
were on alert as night fell in Sydney on Monday amid fears of fresh 
outbreaks of racial violence.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 people were injured and 16 were arrested in some of 
the worst racial violence in Australian history as riots spread from 
south Sydney's Cronulla beach on Sunday afternoon to neighbouring 
suburbs overnight.
</P>
<P>
The violence began when rampaging mobs of drunken white youths 
attacked people of Middle Eastern appearance at the beach, sparking 
revenge attacks by carloads of men who swept through nearby suburbs 
smashing dozens of cars.
</P>
<P>
The city was quiet during the day Monday, but as evening 
approached police seized iron bars from a group of people who had 
gathered in the white working class suburb of Marouba.
</P>
<P>
In the mainly Muslim suburb of Lakemba meanwhile, about 500 
young people blocked roads near the local mosque after evening 
prayers, believing an attack was imminent. They later dispersed, 
some hurling rocks at police, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
The police air wing and mounted officers were expected to patrol 
several suburbs during the night, national radio said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard earlier condemned the violence and 
called for ethnic tolerance.
</P>
<P>
"Attacking people on the basis of their race, their appearance, 
their ethnicity, is totally unacceptable and should be repudiated by 
all Australians irrespective of their own background and their 
politics," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed any suggestion his government's recent warnings 
about the possibility of attacks by home-grown Islamic terrorists 
had fuelled the rampage.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to know how individuals react but everything 
this government's said about home-grown terrorism has been totally 
justified," Howard said, an apparent reference to the arrests last 
month of 18 Muslim men on terrorist charges.
</P>
<P>
New South Wales state Police Minister Carl Scully said white 
supremacists and neo-Nazis were among those involved in the 
attacks.
</P>
<P>
"There appears to be an element of white supremacists and they 
really have no place in mainstream Australian society, those sort of 
characters belong in 1930s Berlin," he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 people gathered at Cronulla beach Sunday after 
email and mobile phone messages called on local residents to beat-up 
"Lebs and wogs" -- racial slurs for people of Lebanese and Middle 
Eastern origin.
</P>
<P>
The move followed assaults a week ago on two white volunteer 
lifeguards at the beach, which is a popular gathering place for 
Muslims from inner-city suburbs, and allegations that local women 
were being harassed.
</P>
<P>
One Muslim woman had her headscarf ripped off and was chased 
into a beach kiosk, local media reported. Six police officers were 
injured as they tried to quell the violence, and two ambulance 
officers were also hurt.
</P>
<P>
A local member of parliament for Howard's Liberal Party, Bruce 
Baird, said he believed the beach rioting was partly fuelled by the 
2002 and 2005 Bali bombings by Islamic militants in which scores of 
Australians were killed.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Islamic Friendship Association of 
Australia, Keysar Trad, told AFP he disagreed with Baird's view that 
terrorism was the issue.
</P>
<P>
"This was just an ugly racist genie that was let out of the 
bottle and we have to put it back in the bottle," he said.
</P>
<P>
Muslims make up just 300,000 of Australia's 20 million people.
</P>
<P>
Australian Arabic Council chairman Roland Jabbour said: "Arab 
Australians have had to cope with vilification, racism, abuse and 
fear of a racial backlash for a number of years, but these riots 
will take that fear to a new level." 
</P>
<P>
New South Wales state Premier Morris Iemma held talks with 
community leaders about how to prevent further violence, after 
reports that a second mass gathering was being planned for next 
Sunday.
