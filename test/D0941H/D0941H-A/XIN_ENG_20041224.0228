The European-built space probe Huygens separated from its NASA
mothership late Friday to begin a descent to Saturn's largest moon
Titan, during which it will sample the atmosphere of Titan.

NASA said in an online news release that its Deep Space Network
tracking stations in Madrid, Spain and Goldstone, California,
received the signal at about 10:24 p.m. EST (0324 GMT).

Titan is the only moon that has an atmosphere in the Solar system.
Its chemistry is believed to be very similar to that of early Earth
before life formed. And scientists hope the on-site probe by Huygens
would confirm the assumption and help them to better understand how
life appears on Earth.
