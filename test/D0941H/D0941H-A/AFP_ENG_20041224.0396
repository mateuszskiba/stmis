<P>
The European-made space probe Huygens has successfully separated from
the US spacecraft Cassini and headed toward Titan, a NASA official
said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The probe successfully detached from the Cassini orbiter," Rosemary
Sullivant, a spokeswoman for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory told AFP.
"They received the signal, I think at 7:24 (0324 GMT) this evening."
</P>
<P>
It will take Huygens 20 days to reach Titan, the only moon in the
solar system which has an atmosphere. It is scheduled to arrive at
its destination on January 14.
</P>
<P>
At launch time, specially designed springs gently pushed Huygens away
from Cassini onto a ballistic four-million-kilometer (about
2.5-million-mile) path toward Titan.
</P>
<P>
The European probe will remain dormant until the on-board timer wakes
it up shortly before it reaches Titan's upper atmosphere, after which
the probe will begin sending data back to Earth.
