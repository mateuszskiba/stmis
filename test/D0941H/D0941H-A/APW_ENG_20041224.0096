Cassini ready to launch European probe to Saturn moon Titan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a gentle shove on Christmas Eve, the Cassini spacecraft will
launch the European Space Agency's Huygens probe on a course that
should send it plunging into the atmosphere of Saturn's big moon
Titan.
</P>
<P>
The probe must be released precisely on course because it has no
means of maneuvering and will remain dormant until a timer wakes it
up for entry into Titan's hazy, hydrocarbon-laced atmosphere and a
parachute descent to the surface on Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
Confirmation of a successful release should be received by NASA's
Deep Space Network antennas in Spain and Goldstone, California, just
before 0400 GMT Saturday (11 p.m. EST Friday), Jet Propulsion
Laboratory said.
</P>
<P>
The $3.3 billion (euro2.45 billion) Cassini-Huygens mission, a
project of NASA, ESA and the Italian space agency, was launched on
Oct. 15, 1997, from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to study Saturn, its
spectacular rings and many moons.
</P>
<P>
During the nearly seven years Cassini took to reach the ringed
planet, the attached probe was powered through an umbilical cable and
awakened from sleep mode every six months for tests.
</P>
<P>
Cassini entered orbit around Saturn in June and has made several
passes by Titan in preparation for the probe's release.
</P>
<P>
Friday evening, tension-loaded springs will push Huygens away from
Cassini on a free-fall toward Titan.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Cassini will perform a course change to avoid following
the probe into Titan.
</P>
<P>
Huygens is designed to make a 2 1/2-hour descent by parachute to the
surface of the moon, which, according to some theories, could have
lakes of methane.
</P>
<P>
Instruments aboard the probe will investigate the atmosphere's
chemistry and cameras will try to record images of the surface. It's
not known whether Huygens will drop into liquid or onto a hard
surface, where it may operate for a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
As long as it is operating, Huygens will be transmitting data back to
Cassini, which will later turn around to point its antenna at Earth
and send the data to the Deep Space Network and on to ESA's Space
Operations Center in Darmstadt, Germany.
