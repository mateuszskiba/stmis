EARTH PROBE SENDS DATA BACK FROM SATURN'S MOON TITAN

BOULDER, Colo.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A space probe landed on the surface of
a moon about 800 million miles away from Earth early
Friday, extending the reach of humans deep into the solar
system and giving scientists their first look at a mysterious
world thought to be similar to primitive Earth.
</P>
<P>
The first black-and-white images from Saturn's moon Titan drew gasps from
a few dozen researchers gathered in a University of Colorado
auditorium to watch NASA television Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In one, snapped from about 12 miles above the moon's surface,
channels appeared to be cut through a light, billowy surface,
separated from a darker, smoother region by a "shoreline."
</P>
<P>
In another, shot from the mysterious moon's surface, were rock-like blobs,
perhaps balls of frozen liquids or "ice boulders."
</P>
<P>
The moon's surface seemed less alien than many suspected, showing eroded
surfaces reminiscent of box canyons, and boulders that looked like
those on Mars.
</P>
<P>
"Wow. I was not expecting to see an image that diverse,"
said CU planetary scientist Josh Colwell. "Something is flowing there,"
he said, pointing to dark streaks cutting through lighter billows
on the first image.
</P>
<P>
"The terrain looks, maybe, like it's been snowed on."
</P>
<P>
NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which spent seven years traveling to Saturn, released
the European Space Agency's Huygens probe, carrying Colorado-made instruments, on
Christmas Eve. Early Friday morning, the probe spun through Titan's
atmosphere, slowed by parachutes that appeared to perform perfectly.
</P>
<P>
Titan is the first moon other than Earth's to be explored.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe its atmosphere is similar to that of the young
Earth, and that studying it could provide clues to how
life arose here.
</P>
<P>
"I think all of us continue to be amazed as we
watch our solar system unveil," NASA science administrator Alphonso Diaz
said as the extraordinary images were displayed on screens at
mission control in Darmstadt.
</P>
<P>
"It challenges all our preconceptions that all these planets are static
places. Seeing a planet emerge that has dynamics and complexity
to it is just amazing."
</P>
<P>
Huygens was spun off from the Cassini mother ship on Dec.
24 before its descent to the surface of Titan.
</P>
<P>
The $3.3 billion mission is a joint effort byamong NASA, the
European Space Agency and the Italian space agency.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say they received more than three hours of data from
Huygens' descent, and more than 10 minutes of data from
the surface itself.
</P>
<P>
At mission control in Germany, scientists shook hands and hugged each
other as they confirmed data were streaming back to Earth
from 800 million miles away. NASA science administrator Alphonso Diaz
held back tears. "Incredible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Boulder researcher Carolyn Porco, also in Germany for the Huygens landing,
marveled that people have now put their mark on such
a distant world.
</P>
<P>
"When we look in the skies and see Saturn, now we
can say we've been there," said Porco, with Boulder's Space
Science Institute and the leader of the mission's imaging team.
