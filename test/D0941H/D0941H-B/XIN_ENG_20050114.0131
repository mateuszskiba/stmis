The European built space probe 
Huygens Friday emitted its first signal during its final descent 
toward the Saturn's largest moon Titan after a seven years' 
interplanetary trip, announced an official of the European Space 
Agency (ESA).

<P>
"The baby is alive", announced David Southwood, director of 
Sciences of ESA from the control center of ESA in Darmstadt, 
Germany.

<P>
The signal emitted by the probe was captured by the 
radiotelescope of the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA) at Green Bank in Virginia, said another ESA 
official, Martin Ransom.

<P>
Huygens' final descent towards Titan started at 1013 GMT and is
planned to land on the moon at around 1234GMT. During the 
descending process, it will film Titan's surface, measure wind 
speed and pressure and analyze the atmosphere as it descends to 
the surface.

<P>
Titan was chosen for the mission since it is the only moon in 
the Solar System that has a substantial atmosphere.
