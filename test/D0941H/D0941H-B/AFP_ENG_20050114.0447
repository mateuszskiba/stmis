The European-US mission to

Dordain, announced here Friday.

Scientists are receiving a stream of data sent back to Earth by 
the US orbiter Cassini, which was relaying a transmission by the 
European exploratory probe Huygens, he said.

"Cassini has started delivering data," Dordain told reporters. 
"We hope to have the first results tonight."

Huygens plunged to the surface of Titan earlier Friday, carrying 
instruments to assess the moon's weather system and methane-rich 
atmosphere during a two-and-a-half-hour parachute glide.
