ABC News says Peter Jennings is diagnosed with lung cancer

Peter Jennings revealed that he is suffering from lung cancer and plans to
continue on "World News Tonight" as much as possible after beginning
chemotherapy next week.
</P>
<P>
Jennings, ABC's chief anchorman since 1983, was replaced by Elizabeth Vargas on
Tuesday but taped a message telling viewers about his diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
"I will continue to do the broadcast," he said. "On good days, my voice will not
always be like this. Certainly, it's been a long time. And I hope it goes
without saying that a journalist who doesn't value _ deeply _ the audience's
loyalty should be in another line of work."
</P>
<P>
A former smoker who quit 20 years ago, Jennings resumed smoking briefly after
the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The 66-year-old anchor was too ill to
work Saturday during the network's special report on Pope John Paul II's death.
He hasn't been feeling well the past few months, and didn't travel under
doctor's orders after December's tsunami because of what was described then as
an upper respiratory infection. He did go to Iraq in January for the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Jennings said he was surprised at how fast the news traveled and at the kindness
he had received from so many people.
</P>
<P>
"Finally," he said, "I wonder if other men and women ask their doctors right
away: `OK, doc, when does the hair go?"
</P>
<P>
Lung cancer is the leading cancer killer in the United States, and roughly four
out of five people diagnosed with the disease die within five years, said Dr.
Cliff Connery, chief of thoracic surgery at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said most lung cancer patients can continue to work throughout
treatment, but need flexibility to take it easy on days they are not feeling
well.
</P>
<P>
With his very visible position on television each night, Jennings could be an
inspiration for many others going through a similar fight, said Dr. David
Johnson, chief of oncology and hematology at the Vanderbilt University School of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
"I think it sets the right example," Johnson said. "I think it says you
shouldn't stop your life if you have cancer. It may take your life, but you
shouldn't let it control your life."
</P>
<P>
There are effective ways to treat lung cancer, but its mortality rate is so high
because so many patients aren't diagnosed until their disease is in an advanced
stage, Connery said.
</P>
<P>
Charles Gibson, Vargas and others will substitute for Jennings from time to
time, said ABC News President David Westin. Gibson is in Rome for coverage of
the pope's funeral, an assignment that Jennings, a former Rome and London
correspondent for ABC News, normally would have taken.
</P>
<P>
"He's already bringing to this new challenge the courage and strength we've seen
so often in his reporting from the field and in anchoring ABC News," Westin told
ABC staffers. "I know that all of us will give him every bit of support that he
needs and asks for."
</P>
<P>
Jennings is the last of the anchor troika that dominated U.S. broadcast network
news divisions over the last two decades. NBC's Tom Brokaw stepped down last
year and CBS' Dan Rather left last month.
</P>
<P>
"Peter is an old friend," Brokaw said Tuesday. "I'm heartbroken, but he's also a
tough guy. I'm counting on him getting through this very difficult
passage."
</P>
<P>
While still in his 20s, Jennings anchored ABC's evening news for two years in
the 1960s. He returned to the desk in 1978 when third-place ABC tried a
multi-anchor format, which was abandoned in 1983 when Frank Reynolds died from
cancer. Jennings has been ABC's sole evening anchor ever since.
</P>
<P>
A Canadian who proudly became a U.S. citizen in 2003, the urbane Jennings
dominated the ratings from the late 1980s to the mid-'90s, when Brokaw surpassed
him.
</P>
<P>
"Jennings has served American broadcast news with a graceful internationalist
intelligence," said Rich Hanley, director of graduate programs at Quinnipiac
University's school of communications. "His manner of news delivery stood in
contrast to but not in opposition of the gentle Midwestern aesthetic expressed
by Tom Brokaw and the don't-mess-with-Texas eccentricity of Dan
Rather."
