Peter Jennings, the suave, Canadian-born broadcaster who delivered the news to
Americans each night in five separate decades, died at age 67.
</P>
<P>
Jennings, who announced in April that he had lung cancer, died Sunday at his New
York home, ABC News President David Westin said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Peter has been our colleague, our friend, and our leader in so many ways,"
Westin said. "None of us will be the same without him."
</P>
<P>
With Tom Brokaw and Dan Rather, Jennings was part of a triumvirate that
dominated network news for more than two decades, through the birth of cable
news and the Internet. His smooth delivery and years of international reporting
made him particularly popular among urban dwellers.
</P>
<P>
"Peter was born to be an anchor," Brokaw said Monday on NBC's "Today." He said
he met Jennings in 1966 covering Ronald Reagan's campaign for California
governor and "we had an instant friendship."
</P>
<P>
Rather, appearing on ABC's "Good Morning America" tribute to Jennings, noted
that beneath Jennings' polished exterior was a fierce competitor.
</P>
<P>
"If Peter was in the area code, I didn't sleep," Rather said.
</P>
<P>
Jennings dominated the ratings from the late 1980s to the mid-'90s, when Brokaw
surpassed him. He remained a Canadian until 2003, when he became a U.S. citizen,
saying it had nothing to do with his politics _ he did it for his
family.
</P>
<P>
"He was a warm and loving and surprisingly sentimental man," said fellow ABC
anchor Ted Koppel.
</P>
<P>
Jennings deeply regretted dropping out of high school, and he would have wanted
that lesson passed along, Koppel said. He made up for it by becoming a student
of the world, studying cultures and their people for the rest of his
life.
</P>
<P>
"No one could ad lib like Peter," said Barbara Walters. "Sometimes he drove me
crazy because he knew every detail. ... He just died much too
young."
</P>
<P>
Jennings was wherever the big story was. He logged more than 60 hours on the air
during the week of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, offering a soothing
sense of continuity during a troubled time.
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people who think our job is to reassure the public every
night that their home, their community and their nation is safe," he told author
Jeff Alan. "I don't subscribe to that at all. I subscribe to leaving people with
essentially _ sorry it's a cliche _ a rough draft of history. Some days it's
reassuring, some days it's absolutely destructive."
</P>
<P>
Jennings' announcement four months ago that the longtime smoker would begin
treatment for lung cancer came as a shock.
</P>
<P>
"I will continue to do the broadcast," he said, his voice husky, in a taped
message that night. "On good days, my voice will not always be like
this."
</P>
<P>
Although Jennings occasionally came to the office between chemotherapy
treatments, he never again appeared on air.
</P>
<P>
Broadcasting was the family business for Jennings. His father, Charles Jennings,
was the first person to anchor a nightly national news program in Canada and
later became head of the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.'s news division. A picture
of his father was displayed prominently in Jennings' office off ABC's
newsroom.
</P>
<P>
Charles Jennings' son had a Saturday morning radio show in Ottawa at age 9.
Jennings never completed high school or college, and began his career as a
reporter at a radio station in Brockville, Ontario. He quickly earned an anchor
job at Canadian Television.
</P>
<P>
Sent south to cover the Democratic national convention in 1964, the handsome,
dashing correspondent was noticed by ABC's news president. Jennings was offered
a reporting job and left Canada for New York.
</P>
<P>
As the third-place news network, ABC figured its only chance was to go after
young viewers. Jennings was picked to anchor the evening news and debuted on
Feb. 1, 1965. He was 26.
</P>
<P>
"It was a little ridiculous when you think about it," Jennings told author
Barbara Matusow. "I was simply unqualified."
</P>
<P>
Critics savaged him as a pretty face, and the experiment ended three years
later. He later described the humbling experience as an opportunity, "because I
was obliged to figure out who I was and what I really wanted to
be."
</P>
<P>
Assigned as a foreign correspondent, Jennings thrived. He established an ABC
News bureau in Beirut, Lebanon, and became an expert on the Middle East. He won
a Peabody Award for a 1974 profile of Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat.
</P>
<P>
Jennings returned to the evening news a decade after his unceremonious departure
and became the evening news anchor in 1983. Starting in 1986, Jennings began a
decade on top of the ratings.
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Kayce Freed, and his two children, Elizabeth, 25,
and Christopher, 23.
