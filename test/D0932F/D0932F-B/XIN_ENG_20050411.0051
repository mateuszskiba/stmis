Changing people's mindset is 
the key to reducing the use of plastic bags, Hong Kong's Secretary
for Environment, Transport and Works Sarah Liao said on Monday, 
adding Hong Kong's supermarkets will offer more incentives to urge
customers use fewer plastic bags.

<P>
Speaking on a talkshow of a local radio station, Liao said the 
proposed plastic bag tax was a complex issue which had to be 
examined carefully.

<P>
On the plastic bags recovery trial, Liao noted dozens of 
housing estates and supermarkets had joined the scheme, which has 
cut the plastic bag use by 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government is liaising with supermarkets on providing more 
incentives to customers to reduce plastic bag use, and a new 
promotion will be launched soon, she added.
</P>
<P>
Liao stressed there was a need to introduce product 
responsibility schemes to lower the environmental risks, and the 
battery recycling scheme launched last week has shown 
manufacturers, importers, retailers and consumers are willing to 
share the responsibility.

<P>
She said product responsibility schemes on tires and 
rechargeable batteries are being explored, while studies on drink 
containers and electrical appliances will be carried out this year.
