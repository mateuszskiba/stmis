The French Ecology Ministry launched
on Monday a program designed to reduce household rubbish by 15 
percent over the next five years and by nearly a third by 2015.

<P>
French Ecology Minister Nelly Olin urged the public to spurn 
supermarket plastic bags and to think about the increasing amount 
of plastic packages they are throwing out daily.
</P>
<P>
According to the ecology ministry, each one in France now 
throws out, on the average, 360 kilo of trash a year and only 12 
percent is recycled and 6 percent transformed into compost, far 
behind its neighbor countries like Germany, Switzerland, Belgium 
and the Netherlands, which all have household waste recycling 
systems.

<P>
The program will cost 2.5 million euros, said the ministry.
