<P>
The government of the western Indian state of Maharashtra on Wednesday banned
the manufacture, sale and use of all plastic bags, saying they choked drainage
systems during recent monsoon rains.
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups welcomed the ban, but said it wasn't enough. Plastic
manufacturers said 100,000 people would lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers and stores selling plastic bags will be fined 5,000 rupees
(US$111; euro92), while individuals using bags face penalties of 1,000 rupees
(US$22; euro18), said the state's top elected official, Vilasrao
Deshmukh.
</P>
<P>
Deshmukh said the ban was prompted by the indiscriminate use of plastic bags,
which blocked sewage and drainage systems during record monsoon rains in July.
Flooding and landslides killed more than 1,000 people in the
state.
</P>
<P>
The ban is to take effect Sept. 24. Until then, residents of the state can file
objections and suggestions, Deshmukh said.
</P>
<P>
Other Indian states have already banned the use of thin plastic bags _ 20
microns or .002 centimeters thick _ used by shoppers.
</P>
<P>
Last month, some prominent Bombay residents, including movie producers, sued the
state government for responding slowly to the crisis created by record rains
last month that paralyzed India's financial and entertainment
capital.
</P>
<P>
Residents blame haphazard planning, bad drainage and poor roads for the flooding
and landslides.
</P>
<P>
"The ban is long overdue and very welcome," said Debi Goenka, an
environmentalist with the Bombay Environmental Action Group. Bombay is the
capital of Maharashtra state.
</P>
<P>
"But to say the flooding was just because of plastic bags is stupid," Goenka
said. "This has to be a first step." Environmental groups have demanded
preservation of open spaces and regular cleaning of drains and
garbage.
</P>
<P>
Arvind Mehta, managing committee member of the All India Plastic Manufacturers
Association, said more than 1,000 manufacturing plants would be forced to shut
down in the state, putting 100,000 people out of work.
</P>
<P>
"The government is passing the buck. We are being made scapegoats," Mehta said.
"The waste management system and people's littering habits should be
corrected."
