Kenya's largest supermarket chain said 
Wednesday it has begun using new biodegradable bags in response to 
growing environmental concerns about pollution by discarded flimsy 
plastic shopping containers.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to keep away any hazards and it's also part of 
our social responsibility to care for the environment," said Mercury 
Anyango, a spokeswoman for Nakumatt, Kenya's leading retailer of 
groceries and household products.
</P>
<P>
The biodegradable bags, which were launched last week, are also 
plastic but specially treated to make them decompose more quickly 
than older versions which can 1,000 years to disintegrate, she told 
AFP.
</P>
<P>
"Nakumatt started using the new product because the normal 
plastic bag is a problem for the evironment and has therefore chosen 
to support the world environment program by using the degradable 
bags for packing goods," she added.
</P>
<P>
Nakumatt uses more than 30 million bags every year at a cost of 
over 40 million shillings (524 million dollars) and Anyango said the 
change will cost 20 percent more.

<P>
In February, the Nairobi-based UN Environment Programme (UNEP) 
and Kenyan Nobel Peace laureate Wangari Maathai warned that Kenya 
faced a growing public health risk from the sea of bags swamping the 
country.
</P>
<P>
Plastic shopping bags that are not disposed of properly block 
gutters and drains, choke farm animals and marine wildlife and 
pollute the soil, they said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they "provide several million habitats for 
mosquitoes to breed that increase the risk of malaria," Maathai said 
at the time, noting that the disease was a leading cause of infant 
mortality in Kenya and throughout Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to the state-run Kenya Institute for Public Policy 
Research and Analysis (KIPPRA) and the National Environmental 
Management Authority (NEMA), at least two million plastic bags are 
distributed each year to people shopping in supermarkets and kiosks 
in Nairobi alone.
