Taiwan conservationists Tuesday 
protested at a government decision partially to lift a ban on free 
plastic bags, saying the move is a setback for environmental 
protection efforts.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) 
announced Monday that from March 1, private restaurants will be 
allowed to distribute plastic bags to customers free of charge.
</P>
<P>
"This is a big step backward in domestic environmental 
education," said Chou Chun-ti, head of an environmental protection 
body grouping mothers.
</P>
<P>
The EPA launched the first stage of a two-part ban in July 2002 
when public catering facilities -- including canteens in government 
and state enterprises, military units, schools and public hospitals 
-- stopped using polystyrene and were banned from using plastic 
bags.
</P>
<P>
The second stage was imposed in January 2003 on private 
restaurants and shops including department stores, supermarkets and 
fast-food outlets.
</P>
<P>
EPA officials found that over the past year, private restaurants 
-- which consume at least half Taiwan's plastic bags -- had ignored 
the ban since the agency had too few staff to implement the policy 
thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
"The EPA should figure out some solutions to solve the problems 
rather than dropping it when it has been half-way done," Chou said.
</P>
<P>
The EPA said the overall policy had been a success because the 
amount of used plastic bags has been reduced to 19,000 tonnes each 
year, from 27,000 tonnes previously.
</P>
<P>
Environmental activists have long complained that Taiwan is 
drowning in a sea of plastic, with more than 16 million bags a day 
handed out on the island.
