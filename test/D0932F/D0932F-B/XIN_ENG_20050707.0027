<P>
A Bangladeshi national task force has
recommended the law against the use of polythene shopping bags 
should be strictly enforced and measures should be taken to 
popularize jute bags.
</P>
<P>
"Law enforcers should strictly and regularly block market 
entrance of polythene bags and nylon net bags being widely used 
recently," the task force was quoted by New Age as saying on 
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The task force formed in January recommended that a technology 
of making shopping bag of yarn, innovated by the Jute Research 
Institute, should be forwarded for commercial production, New Age 
reported.
</P>
<P>
It stressed the need for widespread media campaign to make 
people aware of environmental hazards of polythene bags and 
motivate them to use safer alternatives.
</P>
<P>
Polythene bag came into Bangladeshi market in 1982 and became 
more popular than other bags for its low price and easy 
portability. But they have been blamed for a number of 
environmental hazards including water contamination, clogging of 
drains and sewerage lines in and around the cities and soil 
degradation across the country.
</P>
<P>
Considering the rapid environmental degradation caused by 
polythene, civil societies launched a movement against it and 
finally the government declared a ban on the production, 
distribution and marketing of such shopping bags with effect from 
Jan. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
But the banned polythene bags staged a comeback in different 
forms and types as no suitable, low cost and user-friendly 
alternatives can be promoted so far in wider scale. Nylon net bags
have also made their way recently.
