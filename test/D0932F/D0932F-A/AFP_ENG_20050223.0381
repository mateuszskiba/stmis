Kenya is being swamped with a flood of 
discarded plastic shopping bags that pose a growing public health 
risk and should take steps to ban the popular lould be banned and a hefty levy 
slapped on thicker ones to rid Kenya of an increasing environmental 
and health menace,"  the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) 
said.
</P>
<P>
The call came in a study of Kenya's solid waste management 
presented to UNEP governors who are currently meeting at the 
agency's headquarters here and was backed by Wangari Maathai, last 
year's Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
Discarded plastic bags "provide several million habitats for 
mosquitoes to breed that increase the risk of malaria," she said, 
noting that the disease was a leading cause of infant mortality in 
Kenya and throughout Africa.
</P>
<P>
Maathai, who serves as Kenya's deputy environment minister, 
pledged to push the Kenyan government to adopt measures to reduce 
the use of plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki told UNEP 
officials that his government would address the problem posed by the 
bags but Maathai said she wanted action now.
</P>
<P>
"If I had my way, we would have started that immediately" she 
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
In addition to exacerbating the mosquito problem, plastic bags 
block gutters and drains, choke farm animals and marine wildlife, 
pollute the soil, can ruin Kenya's dramatic natural vistas and can 
take 20 to 1,000 years to decompose.
</P>
<P>
In Europe, Ireland introduced a similar bid to cut down the use 
of plastic bags in March 2002, then dubbed a "plastax". By August 
that year, shoppers had already cut the use of plastic bags by 90 
percent, the environment ministry announced.
</P>
<P>
The government announced that the funds raised from a tax on 
plastic bags would be used for an office for environment 
enforcement, implementing a national waste prevention programme and 
the disposal of fridges and freezers.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and South Africa are moving towards a similar policy, 
according to UNEP officials.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and 
Analysis (KIPPRA) and National Environmental Management Authority 
(NEMA) said at least two million plastic bags a year were being 
distributed to shoppers in Nairobi alone, many of which were not 
disposed of properly.
</P>
<P>
More than 48 million thin plastic bagsng at a rate of 10 percent per year to 
feed massive consumer demand at home and in neighboring countries, 
the study said.
