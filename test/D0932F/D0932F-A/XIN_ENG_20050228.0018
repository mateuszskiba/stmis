Uganda will soon ban the 
manufacture and importation of plastic bags and impose a hefty 
levy on thicker ones, an environment official has said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Aryamanya Mugisha, head of Uganda National Environment 
Management Authority (NEMA), was quoted on Monday by local press 
as saying that the measure would get rid of the increasing 
environmental and health menace.

"We are banning polythene bags and it is a matter of time for 
them to become history," Mugisha said on Sunday in Nairobi, Kenya 
where he is heading a NEMA delegation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the NEMA had made recommendations to the cabinet 
to ban the plastic bags about five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Mugisha said a ban on plastic bags is among proposals aimed at 
reducing the use of polythene, adding that but the tax imposed on 
the plastic bags about two years ago has not helped in restricting
their use because their price is still very low.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected the ban on plastic bags to be effected 
later this year.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda imposed a ban on the manufacture and importation of 
polythene bags last year, while the United Nations Environment 
Program is working with the Kenyan government to ban plastic bags 
there in a new waste management strategy.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is one of the few countries in the Great Lakes region 
where plastic bags are not regulated. Sources blamed the delay in 
effecting the decision on ban the manufacture and importation of 
plastic bags on the lack of political will and protecting those 
who have invested heavily in plastic bags.
