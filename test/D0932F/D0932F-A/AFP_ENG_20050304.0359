New law strips Eritrea of nature-polluting plastic shopping 
bags

<TEXT>
<P>
Parts of Eritrea once littered by a sea 
of flimsy shopping bags are being cleaned up thanks to a new law 
that entered into force in January to help the Horn of Africa 
country protect nature.
</P>
<P>
In the capital Asmara and other outlying regions, the bags have 
been replaced by the cotton and nylon and Eritreans have no choice 
but to adapt to instead.
</P>
<P>
Since January, "those who import, produce, distribute or sell 
plastic bags are fined," said Wolde Yohannes, the head of 
environment wing in the ministry of land, water and environment.
</P>
<P>
Wolde did not give the amount of the fine, but several sources 
estimated that offenders can pay several thousands of nakfa.
</P>
<P>
Since a dollar here is worth 15 nakfa, such fines are hefty in 
the country where, according to an International Monetary Fund 
report, annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is 130 
dollars (100 euros).
</P>
<P>
Authorities here are indeed determined to stem the problem.
</P>
<P>
Individuals are not fined if they are caught with a plastic bag. 
They simply have to tell the authorities where they got the bag 
from, explained Wolde.
</P>
<P>
"If we find that individuals don't cooperate, they could also be 
fined," said Kibrom Asmarom, an official in the environment 
department.
</P>
<P>
Kibrom expressed satisfaction on people's respect on the law, 
nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
Authorities had a raft of reasons for declaring war on the 
flimsy bags that not only block gutters and drains, choke farm 
animals and marine wildlife, pollute the soil, but also ruin 
dramatic natural vistas and can take 20 to 1,000 years to 
decompose.
</P>
<P>
"The animals were eating the plastic bags and dying," Wolde 
said. Loss of livestock can be depressing in this poor country that 
regulary suffers from bouts of drought.
</P>
<P>
"The bags used to clog the drainage pipes. And they were thrown 
everywhere, got stuck in the trees, and spoiled the landscape," he 
added.
</P>
<P>
As animals were dying and drainage getting choked before the law 
came into force, some areas around Asmara used to be covered by a 
sea of coloured plastic bags. Unwittingly, goats and sheep chewed 
them, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Authorities had better plans for the outlawed papers.
</P>
<P>
"We don't burn them, factories which make plastic use them for 
other purposes," said Wolde.
</P>
<P>
"Only a few people have complained about this ban," he added.
</P>
<P>
With a threat of fine, Eritrean in the streets of Asmara have 
no choice but to abide by this environmentally friendly law.
</P>
<P>
Others have even forgotten that plastic bags did exist and 
littered their streets and trash-dumbing zones, just before 
January.
</P>
<P>
"People have already forgotten about plastic bags, they've moved 
on to other things," quipped one Eritrean.
</P>
<P>
While Eritrea has kicked out plastics, a much needed backing 
from  anti-plastic campaign rang at UN Environment Programme 
governor's meeting in Kenya last week, with Nobel Peace Laureate 
Wangari Maathai leading a league to ban the flimsy types.
</P>
<P>
Discarded plastic bags "provide several million habitats for 
mosquitoes to breed that increase the risk of malaria," she said, 
noting that the disease was a leading cause of infant mortality in 
Kenya and throughout Africa.
</P>
<P>
While in Europe, Ireland introduced a similar bid to cut down 
the use of plastic bags in March 2002, then dubbed a "plastax". By 
August that year, shoppers had already cut the use of plastic bags 
by 90 percent, the environment ministry announced.
