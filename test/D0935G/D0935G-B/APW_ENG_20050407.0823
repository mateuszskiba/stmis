<P>
Aaron Harang allowed only one single in 6 1-3 innings and D'Angelo Jimenez had a
pinch two-run double in the Cincinnati Reds' 6-1 victory for a three-game sweep
of the New York Mets on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With a combined four-hitter, the Reds' record improved to 3-0 for the first time
since 1990. They last swept the Mets at home in 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, the Mets hadn't lost their first three games since 1964, their third
year in existence.
</P>
<P>
Harang completed the sweep with one of the best performances of his career,
allowing only three walks and Ramon Castro's second-inning single before letting
the bullpen take over. The Mets failed to get an extra-base hit.
</P>
<P>
Harang topped Kazuhisa Ishii, who allowed only two costly hits over 6 2-3
innings. Wily Mo Pena hit a solo homer in the second, and Jimenez's double
sparked a three-run rally in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
Nationals 5, Phillies 4, 10 innings
</P>
<P>
In Philadelphia, Jose Vidro led off the 10th inning with a homer, leading the
Washington Nationals to their second straight win.
</P>
<P>
Vidro had three RBIs and Brad Wilkerson continued his torrid hitting, going
4-for-5 a day after hitting for his second career cycle.
</P>
<P>
Washington, which moved during the offseason after 36 years as the Montreal
Expos, completed its first series by winning two of three. The Nationals play
their home opener at RFK Stadium on April 14 against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
Vidro hit a 1-2 pitch off Rheal Cormier (0-1) into the left-field seats to start
the 10th. Chad Cordero (1-0) pitched two scoreless innings for the
win.
