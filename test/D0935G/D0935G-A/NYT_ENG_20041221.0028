DEAL IS STRUCK ON FINANCING FOR WASHINGTON STADIUM

<P>
The city's top two political leaders cleared the way Monday night for
Major League Baseball in the nation's capital, after daylong
negotiations to guarantee the construction of a stadium that baseball
officials demanded to relocate the former Montreal Expos here.
</P>
<P>
The city's mayor, Anthony A. Williams, and the City Council chairman,
Linda W. Cropp, agreed, together with baseball officials, to
alterations in the deal the mayor made with Major League Baseball in
September that used mostly taxpayer dollars for stadium construction.
</P>
<P>
Cropp wanted to minimize the use of public money to build a stadium,
which has been estimated to cost as much as $585 million.
</P>
<P>
The compromise will be voted on Tuesday by the full 13-member council
at its last meeting of the year.
</P>
<P>
Cropp persuaded fellow council members last week to adopt an
amendment requiring private financing for the new stadium, where the
renamed Washington Nationals team would play.
</P>
<P>
The compromise reached late Monday assures that 50 percent of the
stadium will be privately financed, said the mayor's spokesman Chris
Bender.
</P>
<P>
Several private financing possibilities already have been
investigated by city officials, Bender said, including a parking
meter plan that is expected to generate $100 million in upfront
revenue for the city. If no other private deals are found, Bender
said, the city expects to sign onto the parking arrangement offered
by the Cleveland-based Gates Group.
</P>
<P>
In return for assurances that private financing is viable, Cropp said
she would drop her legislative language requiring a specific amount
of private financing, a demand which had aroused the ire of baseball
supporters since they feared that it would torpedo the team's chances
of moving here.
</P>
<P>
Baseball officials also agreed to reduce the $19 million in damages
the city would incur if the new stadium, to be built by the Anacostia
River in Southeast Washington, did not open by March 2008. Instead,
the city would forfeit a $5 million yearly rental payment it would
earn when the Nationals team plays at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial
Stadium, which it is set to do beginning in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Baseball officials also agreed to split the cost of construction
insurance with the city to limit taxpayer liability, Bender said.
</P>
<P>
Williams said that having a team was not just about baseball, but
also "about revitalizing the Anacostia River, creating new jobs,
bringing in new tax revenues and creating a new source of civil
pride."
