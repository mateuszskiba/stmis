BASEBALL REJECTS NEW TERMS FOR STADIUM IN WASHINGTON

<P>
Major League Baseball on Wednesday rejected as "wholly unacceptable"
a stadium financing plan approved the day before by the Washington
City Council, throwing into grave doubt the city's plans to bring the
former Montreal Expos here next season.
</P>
<P>
Baseball's statement came in response to legislation the Council
approved late Tuesday night requiring that half of the riverfront
stadium's projected $280 million construction costs be paid for
privately, delivering a stinging rejection of a deal struck by Mayor
Anthony Williams and baseball officials to finance the ballpark
almost entirely with tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a grim Williams expressed pessimism that his plan could
be salvaged. "I do think baseball is in jeopardy," he said. "The
dream of 33 years is now close to dying."
</P>
<P>
Critics of Williams' plan said he was exaggerating the threat that
Major League Baseball would take the team, renamed the Nationals, to
another city. They said baseball had few alternatives, since the
Nationals are scheduled to play next season in Robert F. Kennedy
Memorial Stadium in Washington while their new home is built. Once
the team is in Washington, the city's negotiating position will be
strengthened, they argued.
</P>
<P>
But in a statement, Bob DuPuy, president of Major League Baseball,
called the legislation "wholly unacceptable" and gave the city until
Dec. 31, the previously agreed upon deadline, to approve the original
financing deal. After that date, baseball said, it will begin
considering other sites.
</P>
<P>
"The legislation approved by the District of Columbia City Council
last night does not reflect the agreement we signed," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
DuPuy said baseball had stopped promotional activities for the
Nationals and would refund deposits for season tickets.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal Williams reached with baseball owners to bring the
Expos to Washington next spring, less than 20 percent of the stadium
would have been financed by private funds, specifically through rent
payments from the team.
</P>
<P>
Amid the uncertainty, the one clear thing on Wednesday was the stark
and surprisingly forceful message the Council sent about growing
public resentment toward the high cost of sports stadiums.
</P>
<P>
With land acquisition and service improvements, Williams had
projected that the total stadium package would cost $440 million. But
the city's chief financial officer has put the cost closer to $535
million, and other estimates have gone higher.
