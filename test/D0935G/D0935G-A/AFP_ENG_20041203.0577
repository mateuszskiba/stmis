<P>
Major League Baseball owners Friday conditionally approved the
relocation of the Montreal Expos to Washington for the upcoming
season.
</P>
<P>
The approval was "subject to all conditions set forth in the Baseball
Stadium Agreement," signed by the Expos and Washington Mayor Anthony
Williams.  The agreement calls for the District of Columbia
government to enact funding for a new ballpark by December 31.
</P>
<P>
"This is another important step in finalizing the relocation of the
Montreal Expos to Washington DC," baseball commissioner Bud Selig
said. "We are looking forward to finishing the last few steps,
including the sale of the ballclub, and the rebirth of the club as
the Washington Nationals."
</P>
<P>
The last time a major league club moved cities was after the 1971
season, when the Washington Senators became the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
Until a new ballpark is built, Washington will play at RFK Stadium.
