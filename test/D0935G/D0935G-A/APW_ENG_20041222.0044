Baseball deal back on track with D.C. Council

<P>
Baseball fans in the nation's capital can start dreaming again about
their first opening day in 33 years.
</P>
<P>
The District of Columbia Council voted 7-6 Tuesday to approve
legislation clearing the way for the Montreal Expos to move here next
season and be renamed the Nationals. The measure allows the city to
sell up to $584 million (euro436 million) in bonds for construction
of a 41,000-seat stadium about a 1.6 kilometers (one mile) south of
the Capitol, and for renovations to RFK Stadium, where the team will
play next year.
</P>
<P>
Ticket and team merchandise sales were to resume Wednesday. They were
suspended for a week because of uncertainty caused by changes the
council had made in the city's agreement with the team.
</P>
<P>
"The Nationals are finally rounding third and heading for home," said
Mayor Anthony A. Williams, who negotiated the move with major league
baseball officials.
</P>
<P>
Williams said he will sign the bill as soon as it reaches his desk,
leaving only baseball commissioner Bud Selig's approval of the RFK
renovations for the move to become final.
</P>
<P>
The Nationals' home opener on April 14 would be the first regular
season major league game in the city since the Senators left to
become the Texas Rangers after the 1971 season.
</P>
<P>
The city almost struck out a week earlier when the council amended
Williams' deal with baseball officials to require that half the
construction costs be paid privately, or it would be voided.
</P>
<P>
Baseball officials balked at the provision and threatened to take the
team elsewhere if the original deal wasn't approved by Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
But Williams won the necessary votes after he, Cropp and baseball
officials compromised during a day of intense negotiations Monday.
</P>
<P>
The final bill calls for the city and baseball to split the cost of
insurance that would limit the city's liability on cost overruns or
construction delays. That amendment, introduced by Cropp, also
reduces compensatory damages for the first year if the stadium is
finished late. Instead, the Washington Nationals would not have to
pay $5.3 million (euro3.96 million) in rent if the ballpark is not
ready for the 2008 season and the team has to remain at RFK.
</P>
<P>
A second amendment, approved 10-3, deletes a sunset provision that
would have canceled the deal if there was no private financing.
</P>
<P>
Baseball officials were pleased with the vote and the guarantees that
the stadium would be built as planned, Selig said.
</P>
<P>
"We are also pleased that our discussions with Washington's elected
leaders over the last several days have helped each side better
understand the concerns of the other," Selig said. "We are now more
confident than ever of a long and productive relationship with the
city of Washington as we move forward with this great project."
</P>
<P>
Williams sent Cropp a letter Tuesday, noting his commitment to
include private financing in the stadium package. If there is no
better proposal, Williams wrote, he will use a proposal from the
Cleveland-based Gates Group that would provide $100 million
(euro74.66 million) in return for parking revenues near the stadium.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the measure also made some parliamentary maneuvers to
ensure the bill could not be reconsidered next year, when three new
members who oppose the stadium project begin their terms.
