Real ID, Unreal Expectations

This editorial appeared in Wednesday's Los Angeles Times:

In the absence of a national citizen's ID card, which we're not
against, we're all for Washington establishing some uniform standards
for state-issued driver's licenses. It's too bad, however, that some
in the Congress -- led by House Judiciary Committee Chairman F. James
Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis. -- have hijacked this post-Sept. 11
imperative with their tiresome anti-immigrant crusade.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the House passed Sensenbrenner's Real ID Act, which
would prohibit federal agencies from accepting for any official
purpose state-issued identification cards or driver's licenses that
could have been issued without verifying the recipient's immigration
status. Never mind that 11 states, mindful that the main purpose of a
license is to certify that someone is capable of driving a vehicle,
already offer licenses to illegal immigrants. Also included in the
bill are several unnecessary provisions that would make it more
difficult for deserving people to seek asylum in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The measure is now before the Senate, attached to the supplemental
funding bill for the war in Iraq. The Senate would be wise to strip
these ``Real ID'' provisions from the legislation.
</P>
<P>
Sensenbrenner claims that this is all about fighting terrorism, but
he cannot be serious in thinking that the security of the United
States would be guaranteed by requiring al-Qaida operatives to prove
their legal status before obtaining an American driver's license.
</P>
<P>
What this congressional measure does guarantee is less safety on
the nation's roads, the result of fewer licensed and insured drivers.
Not giving licenses to undocumented workers to drive to work would
only make sense in Sensenbrenner's parallel universe, where the United
States doesn't rely heavily on imported labor. Allowing a driver the
possibility to apply for a license to drive to work means that
person's photograph, address and proof of insurance will be on file at
the local DMV. And that is something to make us all feel safer.
</P>
<P>
The asylum provisions contemplated in Sensenbrenner's bill would
unnecessarily raise the bar for granting asylum to people fleeing
persecution.
</P>
<P>
Although it is true that more than a decade ago the nation's asylum
laws were abused, the regulations enacted in 1994 by the Clinton
administration clearly restrained any further abuse. The numbers tell
the story: Before 1994, the average number of applicants hovered
around 143,000 annually; in 2003, there were about 46,000.
</P>
<P>
Sensenbrenner has indicated that he won't consider any immigration
legislation if Real ID is not enacted into law. Neither the Senate nor
the president can afford to allow him to establish the terms of this
debate.
