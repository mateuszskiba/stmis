At a hearing in the state Senate last
week, California legislators got their first close look at how
the controversial federal Real ID Act will affect the state
budget and ordinary Californians. It was unsettling.
</P>
<P>
Approved by Congress last year, the Real ID Act requires states
to radically change the way they issue driver's licenses if
they want their residents to be able to use that
document as valid identification to board airplanes, enter federal buildings,
and apply for a federal job, Social Security or any
other federal benefit.
</P>
<P>
State officials who have met with a working group in Washington
about implementation say the law will likely be phased in
over a five-year period, beginning in 2008. That means not
all 24 million licensed Californians will have to turn in
their driver's licenses at once. That's a big relief.
</P>
<P>
Still, applicants seeking their first license in California or trying to
get the old one renewed will find the task more
difficult and expensive.
</P>
<P>
At minimum, California will be forced to suspend its convenient renew-by-mail
option that more than 2 million state drivers used last
year. That will mean longer lines at the Department of
Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Besides presenting a birth certificate, applicants will also have to produce
two documents to prove they actually live where they claim.
(Federal regulators are expected to exempt most people born before
1935.)
</P>
<P>
The state's cost of implementing could go as high as $500
million, with individual license holders expected to pay more, possibly
double the current $26 license fee.
</P>
<P>
When Congress approved the Real ID Act, it was billed as
a necessary tool to fight global terrorism. Whether it does
that is an open question. But it's clear that the
new tool won't be cheap or easy to use.
