SOME FEAR LICENSING LAW WOULD CREATE NATIONAL ID CARD
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON - Congress is poised to pass a law that would
make sweeping changes to the nation's system for issuing driver's
licenses by imposing stringent requirements on states to verify the
authenticity of birth certificates, Social Security cards, legal residency visas,
and bank and utility records used to obtain a license.
</P>
<P>
House Republicans attached the bill to a must-pass supplemental spending package
for troops in Iraq without first putting it through the
usual legislative scrutiny of hearings and debate. Should it emerge
intact from House-Senate negotiations over the spending package, it could
be law next month.
</P>
<P>
Touted as an antiterrorism measure, the "Real ID Act" would also
overturn laws in nine states that allow illegal immigrants to
obtain driver's licenses. If a state does not comply with
any provision of the law, its residents would no longer
be able to use their driver's licenses for federal identification
purposes, such as for boarding a plane.
</P>
<P>
The law, some say, would effectively turn the new driver's license
into a national identification card. Its chief champion, House Judiciary
Chairman James Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, says the measure would
help prevent terrorists from fraudulently gaining official documents that would
allow them to enter the country and move freely.
</P>
<P>
Another set of provisions would significantly raise the standard of proof
that asylum applicants must meet when claiming that they have
been persecuted on ethnic, religious, or political grounds. It would
also grant greater discretion to Homeland Security officials to reject
asylum seekers and curtail the ability of appeals courts to
issue stays of deportation orders and review rejected cases.
</P>
<P>
Terrorists have "used almost every conceivable means of entering the country,"
Sensenbrenner said in a statement provided by an aide. "They
have come as students, tourists, and business visitors. They have
also been [legal permanent residents] and naturalized US citizens. They
have snuck across the border illegally, arrived as stowaways on
ships, used false passports, and have been granted amnesty. Terrorists
have even used America's humanitarian tradition of welcoming those seeking
asylum. We must plug these gaps."
</P>
<P>
But many critics of the Real ID Act say that it
goes too far and that its language is riddled with
problems that might have been corrected through the normal legislative
review process.
</P>
<P>
"This bill has not received a single hearing in either chamber
of Congress, so the challenges it presents for states have
never received any attention," said Cheye Calvo of the National
Conference of State Legislatures. "It does much more than just
deny driver's licenses to illegal immigrants."
</P>
<P>
State legislators and governors say that the Real ID Act would
lead to horrific delays at motor vehicle bureaus, that it
would cost hundreds of millions of dollars more than Congress
thinks, and that it would impose an unrealistic three-year deadline
for having the verification system in place.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, civil libertarians argue that by creating uniform national standards for
driver's licenses and requiring states to pool driver information in
a national database, the bill is a back-door move to
creating a national identification card, which they oppose on privacy
grounds.
</P>
<P>
And immigrant advocates fear the asylum changes are too draconian and
will hurt people with legitimate claims of persecution.
</P>
<P>
But Sensenbrenner is pushing hard to keep the measure on the
final Iraq spending bill, and his opinion carries special weight
in Congress. Republican leaders promised him last December that the
Real ID Act would get a quick hearing in 2005
after he agreed to remove it from a major intelligence
overhaul bill that the Bush administration needed to pass.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, political observers say the Bush administration is unwilling to antagonize
Sensenbrenner because, as Judiciary Committee chairman, he will hold sway
over President Bush's proposal to reform the immigration system by
establishing a system of guest worker visas.
</P>

"They're going to stick it on the supplemental, and it's going
to stay on there," Senate minority leader Harry Reid, Democrat
of Nevada, said Monday. "It's a terrible piece of legislation.
... They put it on a supplemental, which they knew
you couldn't stop. I've had a senator come to me
and say, 'We're going to filibuster this.' I said, 'Get
real. It's not going to happen. It's a defense bill."'
</P>
<P>
Six Republican senators last week expressed similar concerns when they signed
a letter asking Senate majority leader Bill Frist, Republican of
Tennessee, not to let the Real ID Act appear in
the final bill. They were led by Senator Sam Brownback
of Kansas, a lawmaker close to evangelical Christian groups who
are particularly concerned about the asylum provisions.
</P>
<P>
"Legislating in such a complex area without the benefit of hearings
and expert testimony is a dubious exercise and one that
subverts the Senate's deliberative process," said the letter, which was
also signed by Republicans John McCain of Arizona, Lamar Alexander
of Tennessee, John Sununu of New Hampshire, Chuck Hagel of
Nebraska, and Richard Lugar of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Lungren, a Sensenbrenner spokesman, Monday rejected the notion that the
bill could use further debate, arguing that the policy proposals
contained in the Real ID Act have been public since
Sensenbrenner tried unsuccessfully to include them in the 2004 intelligence
overhaul law.
</P>
<P>
"Since that [intelligence] bill passed about five months or so ago,
this issue has continued to be at the forefront," Lungren
said. "Just because some senators have chosen not to address
it and to ignore it doesn't mean that we don't
need to have these provisions and bolster our border security
now."
</P>
<P>
Cory Smith, who has been tracking the asylum provisions for Human
Rights First, called Lungren's comments "disingenuous."
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure at some place somewhere years ago something about asylum
was brought up, but there were no hearings on this,"
he said. "There has not been careful consideration of these
serious changes to asylum law and immigration policy."
</P>
<P>
Calvo and Lungren also sparred over how much the driver's licensing
provisions would cost.
</P>
<P>
Lungren pointed to a $100 million estimate by the Congressional Budget
Office. But Calvo said the real amount is more likely
to be between $500 million and $700 million when the
cost of such items as new equipment to tap into
national databases is included.
</P>
<P>
Tim Sparapani, ACLU legislative counsel, said the Real ID Act's rules
would result in a de facto national identification card because
it would require states to pool driver data in a
national database.
</P>
<P>
"When you condition travel on an identification card and create an
internal registry of citizens and a way to track them,
that is entirely contrary to most Americans' understandings of the
way their country works and should work," Sparapani said.
