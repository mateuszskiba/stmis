STATE OFFICIALS WARY OF NEW DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIREMENTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

<P>
Same day driver's licenses could become a thing of
the past under legislation near final approval in Congress, the
National Conference of State Legislators said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The measure, which restricts illegal immigrants from getting driver's licenses and
tightens U.S. asylum laws, was approved by House and Senate
negotiators Tuesday. It is part of an $82 billion emergency
spending bill to fund military operations and rebuilding efforts in
Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as tsunami relief efforts in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to pass the House within days and the
Senate next week.
</P>
<P>
Cheye Calvo, director of the Transportation Committee of the National Conference
of State Legislators said the driver's license measure would cause
chaos and backlogs in thousands of department of motor vehicle
offices across the country, making the nation less secure.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Congress really knows what they are mandating," he
said. "This bill imposes significant new burdens that will affect
all Americans, anyone who has to go to the DMV
is affected by this bill."
</P>
<P>
Some state DMV offices showed a lower level of concern about
the legislation, saying that they already comply with many of
the provisions, but that implementaion of the entire proposal could
be time consuming and costly.
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the measure, dubbed the REAL ID Act, dismissed Calvo's
predictions as exaggerations from a special interest group and say
that the bill would stop foreign terrorists from obtaining driver's
licenses that they could use to travel in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Lungren, a spokesman for the House Judiciary Committee, which spearheaded
the REAL ID Act, said that the states that will
be most affected are the ones doing poorly in verifying
identification documents, including nine "problem" states--Wisconsin, Oregon, Maryland, Michigan, New
Mexico, North Carolina, Washington, Hawaii and Montana.
</P>
<P>
If the states refuse to comply with the new law, they
"will become even more of a haven for terrorists and
illegal aliens to get their driver's licenses," he said.
</P>
<P>
The bill would require people applying for or renewing driver's licenses
to confirm their legal status in the United States. The
residents of states that don't comply won't be allowed to
use the driver's licenses as identification to board planes or
apply for Social Security and other federal benefits.
</P>
<P>
Calvo said that language currently in the bill would require states
to verify the authenticity of each identification document -- including
birth certificates and utility bills, with the original sources.
</P>
<P>
This would require states, within three years, to upgrade 3,000 departments
of motor vehicle offices, train workers, and add employees to
handle all the extra phone calls to utility companies, immigration
offices, and 30,000 vital records offices, some of which are
small and don't have any full time employees, he said.
</P>
<P>
The National Conference of State Legislators has estimated that this effort
would cost $500 million.
</P>
<P>
"State budgets, in many cases, are already in dire straits. And
without federal funding to accompany the federal requirements, some of
the provisions will be difficult, if not impossible, for state
motor vehicle administrators to implement," said Jason King, public affairs
director with the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators.
</P>
<P>
Lundgren said that the estimates are not based on fact and
that the Congressional Budget Office estimated the effort would cost
$100 million in five years.

<P>
Susan Sports, public information officer with the Georgia Department of Motor
Vehicle Safety, said that the state already verifies legal U.S.
residency and Georgia residency and that employees are trained to
spot fake documents.
</P>
<P>
"We have a very secure Georgia driver's license to begin with,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Georgia does not, however, verify each birth certificate with the original
source, instead relying on the certification on each document, she
said. Such a process could take time and states would
hope for federal funding to help, Sports said.
</P>
<P>
It took about a year to implement a real time verification
system for Social Security numbers, she added.
</P>
<P>
Tom Vinger, spokesman with the Texas Department of Public Safety, said
that the department was monitoring the REAL ID legislation "with
great interest," but he didn't want to comment until a
final bill was passed.
</P>
<P>
"We're not really sure what's going to come out and how
it's going to affect us," he said. "If it passes,
obviously, it's going to change they way we do business,
exactly how is yet to be determined."
</P>
<P>
Frank Panela, spokesman for the Florida Department of Highway Safety &amp;
Motor Vehicles, said that Florida has no problem with the
REAL ID Act, because the state already implements most of
the new rules.
</P>
<P>
"We are already way ahead of the game," he said.
</P>
<P>
Florida has a document identification system for Social Security cards, passports,
immigration documents and other documents that have certain security features.
</P>
<P>
Fred Stratmann, spokesman for the Ohio Department of Motor Vehicles, said
that the state would have "minor implementation issues" to comply
with the new measure, including upgrading computers to store digital
copies of identification documents.
</P>
<P>
"Ohio is in very good shape in implementing what the law
requires," he said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Opponents of the legislation also say that it could push more
Americans to obtain passports for identification, if states can't comply
with the difficult mandates. First time passports for adults could
cost as much as $97, including security fees.
</P>
<P>
The Real ID Act was added to the spending bill in
the House in an effort spearheaded by Rep. James Sensenbrenner,
R-Wis., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. The Senate version
did not include the immigration provisions.
