<P>
All of the 16,000 tickets for 
the opening day of Hong Kong Disneyland have been sold out and the
park will open to the public from 1:00 p.m. (0300 GMT) on Sept. 
12, said Eva Cheng, Hong Kong commissioner for Tourism here 
Thursday.

<P>
Speaking at a press conference for arrangements of Hong Kong 
Disneyland's opening, she said the Transport Department, 
Immigration Department, Police and some other government 
departments have made full preparations for the smooth opening of 
Hong Kong Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
The opening of Hong Kong Disneyland is expected to turn on a 
new page of Hong Kong tourism, with focus on family tourists, she 
said.
</P>
<P>
Simon Peh, assistant director of Immigration Department, said 
as one thirds of the Hong Kong Disneyland visitors are expected to
come from the Chinese mainland, the Immigration Department is 
ready to dispatch more staff members to various cross-border check
points during the opening day and other holidays.
</P>
<P>
He suggested Chinese mainland passengers arrive in Hong Kong 
via Lo Wu Check Point, Hong Kong's largest cross boundary check 
point with 233 clearance counters.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the six franchised bus routes that operate to and 
from Hong Kong Disneyland as of Aug. 16, 60 additional quotas for 
cross-boundary coach services to and from Hong Kong Disneyland via
Lok Ma Chau Control Point will become operational from Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Kwoloon-Canton Railway Corporation will also 
operate a "rail-bus" service for mainland visitors to travel 
between the Lo Wu Check Point and Hong Kong Disneyland via Sheung 
Shui Station from Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said, a sample survey made among 3,000 Guangdong citizens
in August showed that over half of the people, who are ready to 
visit Hong Kong in September and October, plan to visit Hong Kong 
Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
To receive more tourists, the total number of hotel rooms will 
be increased from 40,000 at the end of last year to about 54,000 
at the end of 2006, she added.
