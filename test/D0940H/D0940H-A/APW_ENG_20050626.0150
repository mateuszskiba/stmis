Disney officials consulted Chinese feng shui experts before building Hong Kong
Disneyland, making changes such as tilting the site of the park several degrees
and setting up "no fire zones" in kitchens, a company spokeswoman said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Feng shui is the Chinese belief that harmonious energy and therefore better
fortune can be achieved by the correct positioning of furniture and other
objects.
</P>
<P>
Other feng shui influences include the park's orientation to face water with
mountains behind, Hong Kong Disneyland spokeswoman Esther Wong
said.
</P>
<P>
The park's groundbreaking date and opening date of Sept. 12 were picked after
conferring with feng shui specialists, she said.
</P>
<P>
Feng shui experts also designated "no fire zones" in the kitchens, to try to
keep the five elements of metal, water, wood, fire and earth in
balance.
</P>
<P>
Wong said U.S.-based Walt Disney Co. decided to observe feng shui because it
wanted to defer to local custom.
</P>
<P>
"It's cultural considerations," Wong said, noting, "all the food and language in
the park must follow the habits and tastes of our consumers and future
guests."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kongers tend to be Westernized, but Hong Kong Disneyland is expected to
draw droves of guests from neighboring mainland China.
</P>
<P>
However, Disney's cultural sensitivity drew a backlash recently. The park had
planned to serve shark's fin soup, a Chinese delicacy, but dropped the dish
after protests from environmentalists who expressed fears about the extinction
of sharks.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Disneyland _ built on reclaimed land in the outlying Lantau island _
is a joint venture between The Walt Disney Co. and the Hong Kong government, but
local taxpayers are footing most of the construction bill.
</P>
<P>
Critics have questioned whether the government got a good deal. Officials have
said the park will boost employment and tourism.
