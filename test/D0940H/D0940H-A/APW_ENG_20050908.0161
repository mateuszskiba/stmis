Hong Kong Disneyland said Thursday it won't cut its daily maximum capacity of
30,000 people despite complaints of large crowds and long queues from visitors
during rehearsal days.
</P>
<P>
Many of the 29,000 visitors who visited Hong Kong Disneyland for a charity day
last weekend complained of excessively long queues to enter the park as well as
to get on rides, and critics have urged Disney to reduce its maximum daily
capacity, local newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
But a Disney spokeswoman, Esther Wong, said the company is "confident we can
manage peak day attendance in the future and have designed our marketing and
sales plan to manage attendance at Hong Kong Disneyland throughout the
year."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Disney said it was considering extending opening hours and adding more
shows at the park _ due to open Monday _ as Hong Kong's financial chief
expressed concern about the large crowds when the park is operating at its
capacity.
</P>
<P>
The park, a joint venture between the Hong Kong government and The Walt Disney
Co., is expected to draw 5.6 million people in its first year of operation, with
mainland Chinese tourists accounting for about a third of that
number.
</P>
<P>
But mainland travel agents said ticket sales for Hong Kong Disneyland are poor
as the long queues and expensive hotel rates are driving mainland tourists away,
the South China Morning Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We only managed to sell roughly 300 tickets during the first week after the
park opens," Huang Feiyueh, executive director of Amsito Travel Service, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
A survey released Wednesday by Hong Kong's top pro-China political party, the
Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, also showed
that about three out of 10 people who had visited Hong Kong Disneyland said they
won't go back.
</P>
<P>
Wong, however, disputed the criticisms and said "we are confident that our park
will be very popular."
