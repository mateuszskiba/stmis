<P>
Hong Kong Disneyland Tuesday dismissed 
a report that the two-month-old theme park is suffering from poor 
attendence and has failed to attract the number of visitors expected 
by the local government.
</P>
<P>
"We are actually very happy with the attendence over the last 
couple of weeks so we are not at all concerned," said Roy Tan Hardy, 
vice president of marketing and sales for Hong Kong Disneyland.  
</P>
<P>
He declined to reveal the actual attendence figures.
</P>
<P>
"We can tell you it's been very very strong ... we are very 
happy with the way things are going," he told local radio.
</P>
<P>
The South China Morning Post reported Monday that the theme park 
has drawn fewer-than-expected visitors since its opening on 
September 12 and a week after it introduced a discounted price for 
local residents.
</P>
<P>
A headcount of visitors to the park carried out by four 
reporters showed that 12,972 people visited on Sunday November 13 
and 11,399 on Wednesday November 16.
</P>
<P>
The government, which owns a 57 percent stake in the three 
billion US dollar resort, has said it expected 5.6 million visitors 
in its first year of operation, equivalent to an average daily 
attendance of 15,342.
</P>
<P>
The government also refused to reveal the park's daily 
attendance figures although rail operator MTR Corp has said the 
Disneyland Resort line carries 10,000 people on weekdays and 20,000 
on Sundays.
