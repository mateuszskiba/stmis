Disney says "well over" 1 million people have visited Hong Kong Disneyland,
finally relenting in releasing visitor figures amid speculation of disappointing
attendance and criticism that the park _ mostly owned by the local government _
wasn't transparent enough.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong Disneyland has welcomed and entertained well over 1 million guests,"
Walt Disney Parks and Resorts said in a statement issued late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after park officials repeatedly refused to disclose visitor
numbers because of their sensitive nature and media reports that attendance at
the park has been lackluster.
</P>
<P>
The South China Morning Post reported Monday that its reporters counted several
thousand fewer park guests than the projected first-year daily average of 15,342
on two days in November.
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's statement, Disney Parks and Resorts Chairman Jay Rasulo said such
calculations are "meaningless" because they don't factor in seasonality.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom-line is this: Attendance is ramping up well, which continues to give
us confidence that we are on track to achieve our long-term attendance goals,"
Rasulo said.
</P>
<P>
Disneyland's silence until now has frustrated critics who say the park must be
held accountable to the public because of the level of government
investment.
</P>
<P>
The government paid US$2.4 billion (euro2.03 billion) for the park's
construction, while Disney paid over US$314 million (euro 266 million),
according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Disney also said mainland China, expected to be a major source of tourists for
the park, accounted for over a quarter, or 26 percent of guests. Foreigners
contributed 25 percent, and locals had a 49 percent share.
