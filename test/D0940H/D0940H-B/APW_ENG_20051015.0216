Hong Kong leader Donald Tsang Saturday defended the newly opened Disneyland
against complaints of harsh labor conditions, saying Disney needs time to learn
the local culture.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Disneyland employees have complained of long hours, quick turnarounds
and a lack of breaks.
</P>
<P>
"We have to remember that Disneyland is a new organization (in Hong Kong). It
may need time to understand the situation of Hong Kong and especially the
culture of Hong Kongers and figure out how to make all its employees happy,"
Tsang said at a question-and-answer session with local students.
</P>
<P>
Tsang expressed surprise that an experienced company like Disney would run into
problems in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
But he said Disneyland, in which the Hong Kong government has a 57 percent
stake, has gotten off to a "very successful start." The park has not announced
attendance figures.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Disneyland is a joint venture between The Walt Disney Co. and the
local government, but Hong Kong taxpayers shouldered most of the construction
cost.
</P>
<P>
Critics have accused the government of bending over backward to accommodate
Disney.
