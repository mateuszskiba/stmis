<P>
Hong Kong's Disney theme park has 
drawn much lower than expected visitors in the two months since 
opening, a press report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
A headcount of visitors to the park carried out by four 
reporters of the South China Morning Post showed that 12,972 people 
visited on Sunday November 13, and 11,399 entered on Wednesday 
November 16.
</P>
<P>
The government, which owns a 57 percent stake in the three 
billion US dollar resort, said it expected 5.6 million visitors in 
its first year of operation, equivalent to an average daily 
attendance of 15,342.
</P>
<P>
The park failed to attract the crowds despite introducing a 
discounted price for Hong Kong residents from November 8 to December 
8, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Disney and the government have so far refused to reveal the 
park's daily attendance figures.
</P>
<P>
Rail operator MTR Corp has said the Disneyland Resort line 
carries 10,000 people on weekdays and 20,000 on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
A Disneyland spokeswoman dismissed the headcount, saying: "Any 
attempt to count our attendance is flawed" while a Tourism 
Commission spokeswoman declined to reveal the figures for commercial 
reasons.
