Four US ex-presidents, a Hollywood legend, a retired fireman and a
star TV journalist were among those appointed Wednesday to lead the
project for a memorial to the victims of the September 11, 2001
attack on the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
A total of 31 people were named to the board of directors of the
memorial foundation, a non-profit corporation that will construct,
own, operate and maintain the memorial.
</P>
<P>
Along with a slew of prominent business leaders, the list included
actor Robert De Niro, veteran TV correspondent Barbara Walters and
Canadian former prime minster Brian Mulroney.
</P>
<P>
Former US presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush and
Bill Clinton were all named honorary members.
</P>
<P>
"We can never forget the tragic events of September 11," New York
Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"That is why it is so important that when the new World Trade Center
has been completed, we have a memorial that captures the depth of
those attacks and preserves their full impact for future
generations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Reflecting Absence" by architect Michael Arad, which features two
reflecting pools surrounded by gardens, was chosen from 5,201 entries
submitted to an international memorial design competition.
</P>
<P>
The pools are to sit almost empty, with water running down the sides
only, symbolizing the vacuum left by the 2,749 people who died when
two hijacked planes were crashed into the trade center's twin towers.
</P>
<P>
The memorial is scheduled to open in 2009.
</P>
<P>
The memorial board also included retired New York firefighter Lee
Ielpi and Monica Iken, whose husband was killed in the trade center
attack.
</P>
<P>
"At the heart of the rebuilding is the creation of a lasting memorial
which will honor the memories of those we lost and help tell their
story to the world," said New York Governor George Pataki.
