31 NAMED TO RAISE FUNDS FOR MEMORIAL TO SEPT. 11
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The task of raising half a billion dollars to build a World Trade
Center memorial, a museum building and a performing arts center will
fall to a foundation made up of captains of finance and real estate,
cultural leaders, media heavyweights and seven relatives of those
killed on 9/11.
</P>
<P>
After months of searching and one awkward false start last spring
when two prospective co-chairmen, Jerry I. Speyer and Sanford I.
Weill, backed away from the job, Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor
Michael R. Bloomberg were able Wednesday to name 31 members of the
board of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation.
</P>
<P>
John C. Whitehead, the chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development
Corp., will head the foundation until the board members have a chance
to meet next month and select a chairman. Until Wednesday afternoon,
even the designated members did not know whom all their colleagues
would be.
</P>
<P>
Heading the list of boldface names, in one arena or another, are
Robert DeNiro, who has been a presence in the nearby TriBeCa area for
many years; Barbara Walters of ABC; David Rockefeller, who was deeply
involved in the original development of the World Trade Center; and
Michael D. Eisner, the chief executive of the Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
The roster seems to reflect some geopolitical ticket-splitting, with
the chairmen of giant downtown companies like American Express,
American International Group and the Bank of New York balanced by
Robert Wood Johnson IV, the owner of the New York Jets, who hopes to
build a new football stadium on the far West Side.
</P>
<P>
"You probably won't find a board of any higher caliber anywhere in
the city," said Bloomberg, who knows a thing or two about
philanthropy. "And that's really exactly what is called for because
there isn't a more noble task before us."
</P>
<P>
The mission of the nonprofit foundation is to oversee and coordinate
fund-raising and construction of the memorial and the cultural
buildings at the trade center site. It will also own and operate the
buildings.
</P>
<P>
Though the foundation will not formally begin raising money until
next year, Bloomberg all but made the second big pledge as he stood
at the lectern in the lobby of the American Express headquarters in
the World Financial Center at Battery Park City.
</P>
<P>
"As the mayor of New York and also as a citizen of New York," he
said, "I plan to do my part to ensure these projects reach their full
potential."
</P>
<P>
The first big pledge may be said to have come last week, when Pataki
declared in a speech that the highest priority for the remaining $816
million in unallocated federal grants controlled by the Lower
Manhattan Development Corp. should be "to guarantee that we have the
funds necessary to build the memorial."
</P>
<P>
Conceivably, then, the foundation may start its $500 million campaign
with several hundred million dollars already available.
</P>
<P>
Pataki had already said that four former presidents -- Bill Clinton,
George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald R. Ford -- would be
honorary members. One of the working members will be Brian Mulroney,
a former prime minister of Canada, whose presence symbolizes the
international importance of the memorial, said Kevin M. Rampe,
president of the development corporation and a foundation board
member.
</P>
<P>
Speyer, the chairman and chief executive of Tishman Speyer
Properties, whose portfolio includes Rockefeller Center and the
Chrysler Building, agreed to serve on the board that he would not
lead. "I wanted to be helpful but, frankly, it was a matter of time,"
he said Wednesday.
