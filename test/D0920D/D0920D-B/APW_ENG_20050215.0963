Two British newspapers said Tuesday they had paid unspecified damages to the
singer once known as Cat Stevens over articles suggesting he had links to
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The musician, now known as Yusuf Islam, said The Sunday Times and The Sun had
promised not to repeat the allegation and agreed to pay his legal costs and
"substantial damages."
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be the easiest thing in the world these days to make scurrilous
accusations against Muslims, and in my case it directly impacts on my relief
work and damages my reputation as an artist," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The harm done is often difficult to repair. However, I am delighted by the
settlement, which helps vindicate my character and good name."
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times and The Sun both confirmed they were making payments to Islam
but declined to specify the amounts.
</P>
<P>
"There is an agreed settlement," said Richard Caseby, managing editor of The
Sunday Times. "The Sunday Times always denied liability and we disagreed with
Cat Stevens' lawyers interpretation of the article, but we took a pragmatic view
of the case."
</P>
<P>
Janet Anderson, a spokeswoman for The Sun, said Islam's statement was correct
but declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
The stories appeared in the newspapers in October. The Sunday Times ran a
correction in November saying it had not intended to suggest Islam supported
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"We wish to make it clear that he is not and never has been involved in any such
activities and we accept that he abhors all forms of terrorism," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The Sun also ran a correction.
</P>
<P>
Islam was removed from a London-to-Washington flight in September because
American officials suspected him of links to terrorists, a charge he vehemently
denies.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. government has still not told him what the accusation was based
on.
</P>
<P>
Islam said he planned to use the money from the newspapers for aid projects he
started to help children orphaned by the tsunami in Asia.
