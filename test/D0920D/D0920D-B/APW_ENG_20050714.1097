One of Britain's most senior Muslim leaders said Thursday that he was denied
entry to the United States without explanation, nearly a week after the deadly
subway and bus attacks in London.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Zaki Badawi, head of the Muslim College, told The Associated Press he was
denied entry when he arrived in New York on Wednesday. No explanation was given,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He had been invited to speak at the Chautauqua Institution in Chautauqua, New
York, where he planned to give a talk under the title "The Law and Religion in
Society."
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Customs and Border Protection office in New York said when
Badawi's flight from London to John F. Kennedy International Airport landed
Wednesday, customs agents had information that showed he was "inadmissible."
Badawi then voluntarily withdrew his application for entry into the country,
said Janet Rapaport.
</P>
<P>
Rapaport said privacy rules prevented her from disclosing the specific
information that was used to bar Badawi and said she did not know what database
the information came from. She also said she did not know if last week's
terrorist bombings in London had anything to do with barring
Badawi.
</P>
<P>
A federal security official said Badawi was named on a U.S. terror watch list,
but provided no further detail. The official spoke on condition of anonymity
because of the sensitive nature of the information.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy in London did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.
</P>
<P>
No explanation was given for his exclusion, Badawi said in a telephone
interview. "The people I was speaking to were very junior people, and they are
just executing things they were told," Badawi said.
</P>
<P>
"They were very very embarrassed, and I felt sorry for them."
</P>
<P>
Badawi said he had visited the United States many times before, the last time in
2003.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Badawi joined other British religious leaders in condemning the bus
and subway bombings. He appeared with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan
Williams, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Cormac Murphy
O'Connor, Free Churches Moderator David Coffey and Chief Rabbi Sir Jonathan
Sacks.
</P>
<P>
Azim Nanji, director of the Institute of Ismaili Studies in London and a
participant in the Chatauqua conference, said he was "deeply saddened" by the
exclusion of a "moderate voice."
</P>
<P>
"I felt it was very important that Americans should hear, particularly at this
time, a voice from a leading British Muslim who is well respected by the British
government, somebody they turn to for advice," Nanji said.
</P>
<P>
"Inviting the Dr. Badawis of the world into that conversation is crucial," said
Eboo Patel, founder and executive director of the Chicago-based Interfaith Youth
Core, who said he had come to hear Badawi.
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that a large segment of the Muslim community wants to be in a
positive relationship with Western societies," Patel said.
</P>
<P>
"When representatives of that segment, people who have been knighted by the
queen and are close advisers to the government, are rejected, it hurts our
efforts at building multi-faith societies and it gives grist to extremist
Muslims who say, 'See, the West is against Islam, period.'"
</P>
<P>
Tom Becker, president of the Chautauqua Institution south of Buffalo in western
New York, said he didn't know why Badawi was barred. "Whatever it was some kind
of misinterpretation of something," he said.
</P>
<P>
Badawi was given an honorary knighthood and in 2003 he was among the guests of
Queen Elizabeth II at a state banquet for U.S. President George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
Badawi said he was detained for about six hours.
</P>
<P>
"America is a lovely country. There is no reason why it should behave like
that," Badawi said.
</P>
<P>
In September, Yusuf Islam, formerly known as Cat Stevens, was ejected from the
United States without explanation.
</P>
<P>
Islam's flight from London was forced to make an emergency landing in Maine when
U.S. authorities discovered he was aboard.
