British foreign policy played a role in motivating the July 7 London bombings,
former pop star Yusuf Islam said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Islam, who as Cat Stevens had a string of hits in the 1960s and 70s, said an
al-Qaida video claiming responsibility for the attacks and linking them to
Britain's role in the Middle East showed that foreign policy "was not the only
factor but it was a major contributory."

<P>
"At the same time we have to look at how the teaching of Islam has been
distorted," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of Cardiff University's Centre for the Study of Islam in
the U.K., Islam said schools should teach young Muslims the true meaning of
Islam to keep them away from extremist ideas.
</P>
<P>
"Right now there is a more vital role for education to play in painting a truer
picture of Islam," he said. "If you don't give it to the children in schools,
anybody can give it to them on the streets or outside the normal environment for
learning."
</P>
<P>
He also said Muslims should do more to integrate with British
society.
</P>
<P>
"Coming to Islam from a Western background, I was slightly surprised early on by
the insular approach," he said. "I can understand it because many feel insecure
and perhaps they weren't appreciated or were misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
"With a new generation of English-speaking Muslims we have an opportunity to
build many more bridges between the great faiths," he added.
</P>
<P>
Islam, whose songs include the 1971 hit "Peace Train," was removed from a
London-to-Washington flight in September and ejected from the United States
because American officials identified him as a security risk. He says the U.S.
government has still not told him the basis for the allegation.
</P>
<P>
Last November, he was awarded the "Man for Peace" prize in Rome by former Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who praised him for charity work and standing by his
convictions despite personal hardships.
