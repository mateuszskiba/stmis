<P>
Yusuf Islam, the pop musician known as 
Cat Stevens until he became a Muslim convert, will perform a concert 
in Jakarta next week to raise cash for tsunami disaster victims.
</P>
<P>
A statement on his website said Islam, who was deported from the 
United States last September out of being denied entry on "security 
grounds", would also open an office in Indonesia of his charity, 
Small Kindness.
</P>
<P>
Islam, who had hits in the 1970s with "Matthew and Son", "Peace 
Train" and "Wild World", will headline a concert featuring local 
performers on January 31.

"Like everyone else, I was so shaken by the enormity of this 
human tragedy, and the song just came without effort. It is my 
contribution towards helping to rebuild the broken spirits of the 
victims of the disaster," he said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
He has also recorded a new song in response to the disaster. 
"Indian Ocean" features Magne Furuholmen of Norwegian group A-Ha and 
Neil Primrose of Britpop band Travis and is to be released next 
month.
</P>
<P>
The record makes use of musical instruments the singer has 
eschewed since 1977 when he embraced Islam, however, he said it did 
not represent a revival of his pop career.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a return to Cat Stevens, I see it more as a natural 
response to express my concern as a Muslim and as an artist; I 
believe both can exist side by side particularly when the cause is 
right," he said.
</P>
<P>
Islam will be one of the most prominent international artists to 
perform in the world's largest Muslim-populated country for several 
months.
</P>
<P>
A string of big name acts, including Norah Jones, Missy Elliott 
and Alicia Keys, have all cancelled shows due to security fears in 
the wake of deadly bombings blamed on Islamic extremists.
</P>
<P>
Islam denied any link to terrorists last September when he was 
deported from the United States to Britain after his name appeared 
on a security watchlist when he was travelling on flight to 
Washington from London.
