Pop singer turned Muslim activist Yusuf 
Islam, formerly Cat Stevens, said Tuesday he had obtained 
"substantial" damages against two British newspapers which alleged 
he had been involved in terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released on his behalf, the 56-year-old, who sold 
50 million records in the 1960s and 1970s, said he had also received 
apologies for the "false and highly defamatory allegations".
</P>
<P>
The dispute was sparked by reports in the Sunday Times and Sun 
newspapers following the decision by US authorities in September 
2004 to refuse Islam entry to the United States, on what was termed 
"security grounds".
</P>
<P>
Islam, who gave up music and changed his name 30 years ago when 
he embraced the Muslim faith, has repeatedly denied any involvement 
in terrorism, or terrorist funding.
</P>
<P>
Islam's settlement with the two papers saw them also agree to 
pay his legal costs and pledge not to repeat the allegations, his 
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be the easiest thing in the world these days to 
make scurrilous accusations against Muslims, and in my case it 
directly impacts on my relief work and damages my reputation as an 
artist," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The harm done is often difficult to repair. However, I am 
delighted by the settlement, which helps vindicate my character and 
good name."
</P>
<P>
The damages would be given to relief projects in areas hit by 
the December 26 Indian Ocean tsunami, he added.
