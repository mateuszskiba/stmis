Islamic schools, a growing force, spark debate in Britain

<P>
British religious and educational leaders 
were engaged Tuesday in debate over the growing trend of Islamic 
schools, after a chief government inspector warned they failed to 
prepare pupils for life in a diverse society.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Muslim organizations balked at chief English 
inspector David Bell's assessment that traditional Islamic education 
offered by some schools was not suitable for the country's 
children.
</P>
<P>
But several officials at Islamic education bodies acknowledged 
the potential problem of students' social isolation, and said they 
were acting to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
Bell, the head of the Office for Standards in Education, or 
Ofsted, raised concerns about religious-based schools in general, 
but singled out the rapidly-growing number of Islamic schools.
</P>
<P>
"We must not allow our recognition of diversity to become apathy 
in the face of any challenge to our coherence as a nation," he said 
in a speech on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I worry that many young people are being educated in 
faith-based schools, with little appreciation of their wider 
responsibilities and obligations to British society."
</P>
<P>
Bell called on Islamic schools to promote "tolerance and 
harmony".
</P>
<P>
The inspector's comments touched off sensitive debate in 
Britain, which boasts a wide range of secular and 
religiously-affiliated schools, including more than 100 Muslim 
schools in England.
</P>
<P>
The Islamiya Primary School of north London, founded by the 
former folk singer Cat Stevens, now known as Yusuf Islam, became the 
first Muslim school in 1995 to win the public funding long awarded 
to Protestant and Catholic schools.
</P>
<P>
Five of the Islamic schools are now state-run, with the rest 
independent.
</P>
<P>
There are also more than 50 Jewish schools and about 100 
Evangelical Christian schools.
</P>
<P>
Iqbal Sacranie, secretary-general of the umbrella organization 
Muslim Council of Britain, said that while national cohesion was 
important it was "highly irresponsible to suggest that the growth of 
Muslim faith schools poses a threat to 'our coherence as a 
nation'."
</P>
<P>
The school inspector's comments were denounced as "Islamophobia" 
by Dr. Mohamed Mukadam, chairman of the Association of Muslim 
Schools and principal of Leicester Islamic Academy in central 
England.
</P>
<P>
But Idris Mears, director of the same association, said Bell 
raised valid concerns.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's unfair of Mr. Bell to bring the matter up. 
Muslim schools are aware of it. They're putting positive actions 
into place," he said.
</P>
<P>
Musleh Faradhi, head of the London East Academy, a new Islamic 
school, said he "agreed 100 percent with Mr. Bell".
</P>
<P>
"You can't live in isolation, you have to interact with other 
people and understand other people and live with them, and if we 
don't teach our children that it would be a disservice," Faradhi 
told The Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The school head argued, however, that the same warnings applied 
equally to Jewish and Christian students.
</P>
<P>
Some Muslim leaders, including Sacranie, have called for state 
financing of more Islamic schools as a way of ensuring they maintain 
educational standards.
</P>
<P>
Bell agreed, adding that schools which remained independent must 
be "carefully but sensitively monitored".
</P>
<P>
About three percent of Muslim children in Britain attend Islamic 
schools, Sacranie said.
</P>
<P>
According to Britain's last national census in 2001, 2.7 percent 
of the population, or just under 1.6 million people, identified 
themselves as Muslim, mainly originating from South Asian countries 
such as Pakistan and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are dealt with separately 
from England in terms of education.
