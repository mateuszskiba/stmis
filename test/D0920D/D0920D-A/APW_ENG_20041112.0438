U.S. government orders airlines to turn over passenger data
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government ordered U.S. airlines Friday to turn over personal
information about passengers so it can test a system for identifying
potential terrorists. The move was expected but nonetheless brought
protests from civil libertarians worried about invasions of privacy.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, called "Secure Flight," the Transportation Security
Administration will compare passenger data with names on two
government watch lists: a "no-fly" list comprises known or suspected
terrorists, and a "watch" list names people who should face tighter
scrutiny before boarding planes.
</P>
<P>
"Secure Flight represents a significant step in securing domestic air
travel and safeguarding national security information, namely, the
watchlists," the TSA said in a notice announcing the order.
</P>
<P>
The TSA order gives 72 airlines until Nov. 23 to turn over
computerized data for passengers who traveled on domestic flights
during June.
</P>
<P>
The data _ known as passenger name records, or PNR _ can include
credit card numbers, travel itineraries, addresses, telephone numbers
and meal requests. The latter can indicate a passenger's religion or
ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
Barry Steinhardt, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer, said a
major problem is the lists include the names of many people who are
not security risks.
</P>
<P>
Among those subjected to extra scrutiny in recent months was Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy. The singer formerly known as Cat Stevens, now
Yusuf Islam, is trying to get off the no-fly list after he was
removed from a London-to-Washington flight because the list said he
had links to terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The lists are "a hodgepodge of information, accurate and inaccurate,"
Steinhardt said. "They're the basement of the program, and the floor
is rotten."
</P>
<P>
The government has sought to improve its process for checking
passengers since the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers exposed holes. The
government's first attempt was scuttled because of fears the
government would have access to too much personal information.
</P>
<P>
The TSA says Secure Flight differs from the previous plan because it
does not compare personal data with commercial databases. The agency
said, however, it will test the passenger information "on a very
limited basis" against commercial data.
</P>
<P>
Under the current system, the government shares parts of the
watchlists with airlines, which are responsible for making sure
suspected terrorists don't get on planes. But the airlines don't have
access to everyone who's considered a threat to aviation because some
of the names of known or suspected terrorists are classified.
</P>
<P>
People within the commercial aviation industry say there are more
than 100,000 names on the lists.
</P>
<P>
Under Secure Flight, the government would take responsibility for
checking passengers. That was among recommendations of the commission
that investigated the Sept. 11 attacks.
</P>
<P>
An airline industry representative said the carriers support the
government's goals but remain wary of privacy concerns.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. airlines have long-standing concerns that center on privacy and
operational issues," said James May, president of the Air Transport
Association, which represents major airlines. "We hope many of the
issues will be successfully addressed during the test phase of Secure
Flight."
</P>
<P>
In issuing the order, the TSA didn't resolve another key concern for
privacy advocates: redress. There still is no formal way for people
mistakenly identified as terrorists, or who have the same name as a
suspected terrorist, to get off the lists.
</P>
<P>
Justin Oberman, who heads the TSA office that's developing Secure
Flight, said the agency will set up a passenger advocate's office to
handle complaint from passengers. He said a process of redress wasn't
needed until Secure Flight begins.
</P>
<P>
Oberman said the TSA will present the final plan for Secure Flight
early next year.
