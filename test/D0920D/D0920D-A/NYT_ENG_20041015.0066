LABELING REVS UP THE IRE OF CHEVELLE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to the intense rock of Chevelle, don't confuse the
band's roiling energy with anger. Don't mistake introspection for
depression.
</P>
<P>
And, don't mistake the trio for "Christian rockers," as critics and
industry execs in the past have tried to tag them.
</P>
<P>
"It's not only a label we didn't want, it's untrue," Joe Loeffler,
bassist and vocalist, said by phone recently. "It's kind of
frustrating, because we deal with it so much.
</P>
<P>
"With us, really, there's no label you can apply; it's so difficult
to."
</P>
<P>
And there's no need to, he added.
</P>
<P>
Just as well. Ask Loeffler and his bandmates/siblings Sam and Pete to
list the music that influenced the band's sound, and they'll list
Helmet, Tool, Sinead O'Connor and Yusuf Islam -- the artist once
known as Cat Stevens and most recently in the news as being on the
United State's no-fly list for alleged ties to terrorism, an
accusation the artist vehemently denies.
</P>
<P>
"My favorite artist, probably because of her stability, in doing what
she tries to do record after record, is Enya," said Joe Loeffler, 24.
</P>
<P>
And what links such an eclectic mix to Chevelle?
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty cheesy, but the thread is, it's good music," Loeffler
said.
</P>
<P>
That, and passion.
</P>
<P>
"Music is so much feeling and emotion," he said. "A lot of those
artists -- Cat Stevens and Sinead and Helmet -- that's emotion. It's
not crap; writing 'happy' songs for people. It's making music with
emotion."
</P>
<P>
Chevelle has been living by that simple creed since first forming in
Chicago in 1995. The band -- Sam, 29, mans the drums, and Pete, 27,
handles guitars and vocals -- ripped through local clubs for four
years before releasing its debut album, "Point .1."
</P>
<P>
In 2002, the brothers hit the big time with the release of "Wonder
What's Next" and its chart-topping single, "Send the Pain Below."
</P>
<P>
The latest offering, "This Type of Thinking (Could Do Us In)" came
out in late September and peaked -- so far -- at No. 8 on the
Billboard 200 album chart.
</P>
<P>
Like its predecessors, it carries rich melodies dotted by guitar
riffs and lyrics that probe issues from Ritalin use to the incessant
demands of society -- lyrics some see as dark.
</P>
<P>
"From our side, it's not dark," Loeffler said. "It seems like energy,
like
</P>
<P>
powerful. Some songs are angry; some are more kind of emotional.
That's not dark to me.
</P>
<P>
"It's not like we're a freakin' hardcore band, with the repetitive
screaming. I don't think we're very angry."
</P>
<P>
Nor Christian rockers.
</P>
<P>
Or, for that matter, any "type" of rocker.
</P>
<P>
"Good music doesn't have to have a name on it," Loeffler said. "That
sounds cheesy, but it's true."
