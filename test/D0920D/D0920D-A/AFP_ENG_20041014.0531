<P>
Cat Stevens, who abandoned his music career when he converted to
Islam and changed his name to Yusuf Islam 30 years ago, is making a
surprise comeback with a single that could top the charts at
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
Yusuf Islam, 56, who sold 50 million records in the 1960s and 1970s,
has recorded a version of his 1970 hit "Father and Son" with Ronan
Keating, the Irish former boy-band star, The Times newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bookmaker William Hill tipped the song Wednesday as the 7-1
favorite to become the Christmas No 1, it added.
</P>
<P>
As Cat Stevens, Islam enjoyed a string of hits including "Wild World"
and "Moonshadow." He converted to Islam after nearly drowning in
California in 1976.
</P>
<P>
He avoided recording secular music, believing mistakenly, he now
admits, that it was forbidden by the Koran.
</P>
<P>
He devoted himself to creating single-faith Islamic schools in
Britain but denies delivering funds to the Islamic militant group
Hamas in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Islam has known Keating, a former member of Boyzone, for a decade.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Keating told The Times: "They first met ten years ago
when Boyzone performed 'Father and Son' on 'Top Of The Pops' (on BBC
television) and stayed in touch. Ronan asked him to do the duet and
he said yes."
</P>
<P>
Islams recent journey to Nashville, curtailed by the US authorities,
was to discuss plans for a new album.
</P>
<P>
He is writing a Broadway musical based on his hits and sang at a
charity concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London, his first live
appearance in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Islam has denied supporting terrorist organisations.
</P>
<P>
Islam was deported from the United States last month after being
denied entry on "security grounds" and was released without charge.
