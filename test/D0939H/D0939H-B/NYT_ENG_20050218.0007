COPS: TRAIN CRASH PLOY TO GAIN WIFE'S ATTENTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
GLENDALE, Calif.
</DATELINE>

<P>
The laborer charged with triggering the deadly Metrolink
derailment was making a "twisted" attempt to win back his
estranged wife -- not trying to commit suicide -- when
he abandoned his SUV on the tracks, police said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Juan Manuel Alvarez, 25, deliberately parked his Jeep Grand Cherokee on
the tracks and doused both the exterior and interior of
his car with gasoline, planning to create a "spectacular" scene
to gain his wife's sympathy, Glendale police Lt. Jon Perkins
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
"He had a number of choices to make. He could have
torched himself, laid on the tracks, put the car on
the tracks, but he didn't choose any of those. We
believe that this was nothing more than an attention-getting model
to have his wife take him back.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he ever intended to kill himself."
</P>
<P>
During Alvarez's arraignment on Tuesday, prosecutors added arson charges to the
11 counts of murder with special circumstances already filed against
the Compton man. He pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
"It was a deliberate act with total disregard for anybody else,"
Perkins said in providing new details of the Jan. 26
crash that killed 11 people and injured nearly 200 others.
"He only had a selfish motivation in mind. It was
his twisted way of gaining sympathy from his wife."
</P>
<P>
Police would not say whether Alvarez called his wife before or
after crash. However, detectives said while he was in the
hospital he continually asked if his wife was there.
</P>
<P>
"He was concerned to know if his wife was at the
hospital and if this incident brought her to see him,"
said Detective Bob Breckenridge.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez's attorney, Eric Chase, released a statement criticizing the police for
their comments.
</P>
<P>
"The statements of Glendale police today are not only vicious and
callous but are a reckless distortion of the facts," he
said. "If they want to make this case about, as
they say, 'Juan Alvarez's intent to cause a horrific tragedy,'
I hope they can back it up."
</P>
<P>
The District Attorney's Office refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police they saw Alvarez park his SUV parallel to
the tracks, then pour a liquid -- investigators have since
detected gasoline on the wreckage -- from a plastic container
on its hood and roof. Moments later, the SUV was
parked with its front wheels on the track and Alvarez
on the passenger side with the door open.
</P>
<P>
He was then seen "engaged in some type of activity" inside
the Cherokee until he saw the train coming, Perkins said.
</P>
<P>
"When the train started approaching, he started running," Perkins said.
</P>
<P>
Authorities have said that Alvarez was horrified when he saw the
crash and ran to a friend's house in nearby Atwater
Village. He stabbed at his wrists and chest with scissors,
which led to early speculation that the crash was the
result of an aborted suicide attempt.
</P>
<P>
Two days after the crash, Metrolink filed suit against Alvarez, claiming
his actions caused the derailment of a southbound commuter train.
It collided with a parked Union Pacific locomotive, then crashed
into a northbound Metrolink train.
</P>
<P>
Rita Tutino, whose husband, Los Angeles sheriff's Deputy James Tutino, died
in the crash, filed a claim earlier this week, claiming
Metrolink was negligent in its management and operation of the
commuter line.
</P>
<P>
In a phone interview Thursday, Rita Tutino said that whatever his
intent, Alvarez knew that placing his car on the tracks
would endanger the lives of hundreds of people.
</P>
<P>
"Why didn't he just go buy her roses? Why didn't he
write her a letter? Why didn't he go get help?
You don't put at risk the lives of hundreds of
people," she said. "I'm one of 11 families that lost
a family member.
</P>
<P>
"It's utterly ridiculous whether he's trying to kill himself or trying
to get the attention of his wife."
</P>
<P>
Perkins said investigators are working with prosecutors to prove that Alvarez's
actions were not influenced by mental illness.
