<P>
The man accused of causing a collision of two commuter trains that killed 11
people and injured nearly 200 pleaded not guilty Thursday to murder and arson
charges.
</P>
<P>
Juan Manuel Alvarez, 26, allegedly parked his Jeep on tracks in suburban
Glendale early Jan. 26, then abandoned the vehicle as a Metrolink train
approached. The train crashed into the Jeep and derailed, slamming into an
oncoming train.
</P>
<P>
Glendale police have said that while it initially appeared Alvarez was trying to
commit suicide, the discovery of other evidence, including gasoline doused on
the sport utility vehicle, showed he was trying to cause the
crash.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez faces 11 counts of murder and one count of arson. He appeared in court
briefly Thursday and was scheduled to return July 22 for a pretrial
hearing.
</P>
<P>
Special circumstance allegations could result in the death penalty if Alvarez is
convicted, but prosecutors say they haven't decided whether to seek a death
sentence.
