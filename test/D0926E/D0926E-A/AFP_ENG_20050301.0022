The early stages of American 
adventurer Steve Fossett's bid to make the first solo non-stop 
flight around the world without refueling aboard the GlobalFlyer 
have gone "exactly as planned", organizers said.
</P>
<P>
"Mission control has spoken with Steve and he reports that 
everything is working well and that he is extremely pleased with 
progress so far," project manager Paul Moore told a press briefing 
late Monday.
</P>
<P>
After weeks of weather delays, the GlobalFlyer took off at 6:47 
pm (0047 GMT Tuesday) from Salina Municipal Airport on a journey 
expected to last between 60 and 80 hours.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of spectators lined the tarmac and cheered as the 
aircraft, heavily laden down by fuel, trundled down the runway and 
rose into the darkening sky.
</P>
<P>
There was a brief moment of anxiety when the craft appeared to 
lose altitude seconds after taking off, before it regained height 
and climbed into the skies.
</P>
<P>
Fossett spoke briefly to reporters before climbing into the 
cramped cockpit.
</P>
<P>
"I'm feeling good. I'm feeling healthy. It's going to be a long 
night tonight and a long night tomorrow night," he said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day journey will test Fossetts endurance and his 
abilities as a pilot.
</P>
<P>
The delicate, light-bodied airplane has been built with very 
little margin for complications like turbulence and Fossett will 
need to keep a close eye on the fuel distribution to ensure that the 
plane remains properly balanced.
</P>
<P>
The greatest potential for structural problems came during the 
first two hours of the flight when Fossett maneuvered the plane 
through the ground winds and potential turbulence.
</P>
<P>
At takeoff, the 3,350-pound (1,522-kilogram) single engine 
aircraft was carrying nearly 19,000 pounds (8,636 kilograms) of fuel 
in 13 tanks for the 23,000-mile (37,260-kilometer) journey at 
altitudes as high as 52,000 feet (15,850 meters).
</P>
<P>
Fossett is wearing a chest pack with a parachute and should be 
able to bail out in less than two minutes if he encounters any 
critical failures. Once he reaches his cruising altitude of about 
45,000 feet (13,000 meters) he can expect a smoother ride.
</P>
<P>
By 10:00pm (0400 GMT, Tuesday) Fossett had traveled 1,400 
kilometers (869 miles) and was approaching Canadian airspace after 
having passed over Chicago and Detroit. He was flying at an altitude 
of 38,000 feet (11,580 meters) at an approximate speed of 310 knots 
(357 miles per hour).
</P>
<P>
While in the air, Fossett will be in near-constant contact with 
mission control here via a NASA-designed communication system.
</P>
<P>
"It was obviously an emotional moment in that I was standing 
with Steve Fossett's wife. It was a dangerous moment and an enormous 
relief when it got off the ground and left Salina," said British 
entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson, whose Virgin Atlantic Airways is 
funding the daring venture.
</P>
<P>
"Something I never thought I would get to say was 'next stop 
Salina,'"  Branson said.
</P>
<P>
A chase plane is following Fossett along the route in order to 
document the flight and provide support should he be forced into an 
early landing. Fossett has been equipped with an emergency beacon 
which would alert search-and-rescue teams to his exact position.
</P>
<P>
Fossett has little room to stretch in the 7.7-foot-long 
(2.3-meter-long) cabin and will sustain himself with diet 
milkshakes.
</P>
<P>
Despite the dangers, Fossett said he is determined to try to 
capture the "most important aviation records that have been left 
undone." "It's worth the risk," he said.
</P>
<P>
The project brings together three giants of aviation and 
adventure.
</P>
<P>
Fossett has set dozens of world records and world firsts with 
jet airplanes and gliders, hot air balloons and sailing.
</P>
<P>
The former stock options trader became famous in the mid 1990s 
when he made an attempt with Branson to circumnavigate the globe in 
a hot air balloon. He managed the trip solo on his sixth attempt in 
the summer of 2002.
</P>
<P>
Branson has set a number of sailing and aviation records in his 
own right while promoting the Virgin brand. He will monitor 
Fossett's progress from mission control in Salina.
</P>
<P>
The GlobalFlyer was designed by aviation legend Burt Rutan, who 
recently made headlines when his SpaceShipOne won the 10 million 
dollar "X Prize" for sending a privately-designed craft into space 
twice in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Rutan also designed the Voyager, which was used by his brother 
Dick Rutan and Jeanne Yeager in 1986 to set a record of nine days 
for a non-stop, non-refueled flight around the world.
</P>
<P>
Fossett hopes to beat that record by making it in less than 80 
hours, and by doing it on his own.
</P>
<P>
Once he clears the Canadian province of Newfoundland, Fossett 
will head across the Atlantic Ocean to Africa. 
</P>
<P>
He hopes pass above Casablanca before he continuing on towards 
Libya, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, China, 
South Korea and Japan.
