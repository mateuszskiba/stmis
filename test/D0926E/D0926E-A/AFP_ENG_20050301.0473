American adventurer Steve 
Fossett flew over Africa on Tuesday after battling a series of 
equipment problems in the early stages of his bid to make the first 
solo non-stop flight around the world without refueling.
</P>
<P>
Fossett, who took off from here in the Virgin Atlantic 
GlobalFlyer on Monday for a flight expected to last between 60 and 
80 hours, said he had to deal with a number of "dramas," 
particularly during takeoff, but the flight was going well overall.
</P>
<P>
At 1607 GMT, Fossett was at approximately 45,000 feet (13,000 
meters) and had been in the air for 15 hours and 20 minutes. The 
GlobalFlyer was over Morocco heading east at a speed of around 340 
knots (390 miles per hour/630 kilometers per hour)
</P>
<P>
"At this time everything is going very well," Fossett said in a 
radio hook-up with reporters at Mission Control in Salina. "I'm very 
happy with the situation and I think we've got a good chance."
</P>
<P>
He said the takeoff of the GlobalFlyer, which is essentially a 
flying gas tank -- 83 percent of the total weight is fuel -- had 
been difficult. "It had a lot of dramas in the launch, dramas with 
equipment failures that had to be solved," Fossett said.
</P>
<P>
"The plane was much slower than I expected but fortunately the 
plane picked up speed and I didn't have to abort," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the problems was a temporary failure of the Global 
Positioning System, or GPS, Fossett's primary navigation aid.
</P>
<P>
"This was my sole source of navigation so this was very 
serious," he said, adding that the GPS had not functioned for about 
half of his flight over Canada. "I believe it was an antenna 
problem," Fossett said.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that other problems could arise during the flight 
and there was still a long way to go. "There may be new things that 
come up so there's no real basis for confidence," he said, "but I'm 
happy with the situation."
</P>
<P>
Fossett said he had consumed three chocolate milkshakes since 
the flight began. "It's not exactly my favorite diet but it will 
certainly serve the purpose for this flight."
</P>
<P>
At Mission Control, flight controllers were carefully monitoring 
fuel consumption.
</P>
<P>
"One of the critical factors we are monitoring is the amount of 
fuel he has left," said project manager Paul Moore. "He's eaten 
quite substantially into his fuel (so far)  but that's as we 
expected."
</P>
<P>
Moore said the GPS problem had been potentially very serious. 
"This could have been a showstopper," he said. "This was really a 
big worry as we are unable to fly without GPS especially when were 
out of radio range.
</P>
<P>
"Steve was essentially flying blind," Moore said. "Happily, 
after a couple of hours of malfunction the GPS system did 
reengage."
</P>
<P>
The three-day journey will test the endurance and piloting 
abilities of Fossett, a 60-year-old millionaire who has set dozens 
of world records and world firsts with jet airplanes and gliders, 
hot air balloons and sailing.
</P>
<P>
At takeoff, the 3,350-pound (1,522-kilogram) single engine 
aircraft was carrying nearly 19,000 pounds (8,636 kilograms) of fuel 
in 13 tanks for the 23,000-mile (37,260-kilometer) journey at 
altitudes as high as 52,000 feet (15,850 meters).
</P>
<P>
Virgin Atlantic Airways of Sir Richard Branson is funding the 
GlobalFlyer and the British entrepreneur is in Salina monitoring the 
flight.
</P>
<P>
The GlobalFlyer was designed by aviation legend Burt Rutan, who 
recently made headlines when his SpaceShipOne won the 10 million 
dollar "X Prize" for sending a privately-designed craft into space 
twice in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Rutan also designed the Voyager, which was used by his brother 
Dick Rutan and Jeanne Yeager in 1986 to set a record of nine days 
for a non-stop, non-refueled flight around the world.
</P>
<P>
Fossett hopes to beat that record by making it in less than 80 
hours, and by doing it on his own.
