Jet stream delays launch of solo, non-stop trip around the 
world

NEW YORK, Feb 8

<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Fossett is waiting on the wind.
</P>
<P>
With all preparations complete for a solo, non-stop flight 
around the globe, the only thing standing in the way of the 
legendary adventurers next attempt to set a world record is an 
uncooperative jet stream.
</P>
<P>
"It's never been an exact science," said spokeswoman Anna 
Burdsall. "There are two different weather systems we're dealing 
with -- the ground weather in Salinas, that's one consideration, and 
the other is the weather and the jet stream going around the 
world."
</P>
<P>
The launch of the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer has been delayed a 
number of times since it arrived in Salinas, Kansas, on January 7.
</P>
<P>
The light-bodied aircraft relies on prevailing winds, or the jet 
stream, to help push it along its journey. But it needs to avoid the 
jet stream until it reaches its cruising altitude or else it could 
be damaged by heavy turbulence.
</P>
<P>
A February 2 launch was cancelled because the jet stream moved 
too far north, which meant Fossett would lose too much fuel catching 
up to it to make it the rest of the way around the world.
</P>
<P>
The February 6 and February 8 launches were cancelled because 
the jet stream moved too close to Kansas and created a situation of 
heavy wind and turbulence.
</P>
<P>
So Fossett and his crew have remained on high alert, waiting for 
the perfect weather conditions. The next potential launch date is 
late next week.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone within the project team understands how these type of 
projects work," said Burdsall, who described the mood of the 30-plus 
people working on the project as one of anticipation.
</P>
<P>
The project brings together three giants of aviation and 
adventure.
</P>
<P>
Fossett has set dozens of world records and world firsts with 
jet airplanes and gliders, hot air balloons and sailing. The 
American millionaire became famous in the mid 1990s when he made a 
number of attempts with British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson to 
fly around the globe in a hot air balloon.
</P>
<P>
Branson, whose company Virgin Atlantic Airways is funding the 
GlobalFlyer, is acting as the reserve pilot.
</P>
<P>
The British businessman has also set a number of sailing and 
aviation records in his own right while promoting the Virgin brand. 
He will monitor Fossett's progress from mission control in Salinas.
</P>
<P>
The GlobalFlyer was designed by Burt Rutan, who recently made 
headlines when his SpaceShipOne won the 10-million-dollar "X Prize" 
for sending a privately-designed craft into space twice in two 
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Rutan also designed the Voyager, which was used by his brother 
Dick Rutan and Jeanne Yeager in 1986 to set a record of nine days 
for a non-stop, non-refueled flight around the world.
</P>
<P>
Fossett hopes to beat that record by making it in less than 80 
hours, and by doing it on his own.
</P>
<P>
"The first solo non-stop is a grand endeavour," Fossett said in 
an interview on the GlobalFlyer Web site.
</P>
<P>
"This will require all of my abilities as a pilot, it will test 
my endurance, and it will demonstrate the finest in lightweight 
aircraft construction and improvements in jet engine fuel efficiency 
that have never before been achieved."
</P>
<P>
The 3,350-pound (1,522-kilogram) single engine aircraft will 
carry nearly 19,000 pounds (8,636 kilograms) of fuel in 13 tanks for 
the 23,000-mile (37,260-kilometer) journey.
</P>
<P>
Some of the major cities Fossett expects to pass along the way 
are Chicago, Toronto, London, Paris, Rome, Cairo, Bahrain, Karachi, 
Calcutta, Shanghai, Tokyo, Honolulu and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Virgin is looking for people with high powered telescopes to 
operate as spotters and take pictures and video of the plane as it 
flies overhead at 45,000 feet (13,636 meters).
