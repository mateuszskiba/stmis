For GlobalFlyer, "Mission Accomplished"

The Kansas City Star SALINA. Kan. -- Steve Fossett had just
endured 67 hours in a cramped cockpit, with only milkshakes
for sustenance, not knowing for half the way whether he
had enough fuel to get home.
</P>
<P>
But when he emerged from the cockpit of his GlobalFlyer at
2 p.m., having become the first to fly a plane
solo around the world without refueling, one might have thought
he was returning from an afternoon jaunt.
</P>
<P>
The burly 60-year-old, dressed in a silvery flight suit, popped out
his head, acknowledged the crowd gathered at Salina Municipal Airport
with a wave and walked steadily into the arms of
his wife, Peggy Fossett. Then, in a most understated way,
he told the crowd: "I'm a really lucky guy. I
got to achieve my ambition."
</P>
<P>
Fossett seemed to take his latest adventure in stride, but city
leaders and aviation authorities called it a very big deal.
</P>
<P>
"This is a monumental achievement in aviation," said David Hawksett of
London, who assesses scientific achievements for Guinness World Records. In
terms of significant firsts, he said, Fossett's feat is on
par with the 1969 moon landing and the 1953 climb
up Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of thing makes people sit up and say, 'Wow,
look what can be done!"'
</P>
<P>
More important, Hawksett said, it "inspires kids all over the world."
</P>
<P>
Clif Berry Jr., who wrote 2002's Milestones of the First Century
of Flight , said Fossett's accomplishment was "an incredible feat."
</P>
<P>
"Just imagine, there you are all alone at 45,000 feet, with
no chance to refuel. It's just marvelous," Berry said
</P>
<P>
"I do hope it inspires the young and old to have
their own challenges and go after them."
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Rice, vice president of the Salina Chamber of Commerce, said
Fossett's achievement put her city on the map. It is
a significant addition to the city's already rich aviation history,
she said.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was so excited to see that plane come in," Rice
said. "You could feel the adrenaline and emotion, and people
were crying, and it was wonderful."
</P>
<P>
Mission control directors estimated the crowd in the thousands. People were
strung out in groups along the 2.5-mile runway.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the 1:47 p.m. touchdown, the mission's project director told
media gathered on the south side of the runway that
Fossett would not do a flyover because turbulence had made
the plane difficult to handle.
</P>
<P>
"The aircraft is so light now that he is not going
to take the risk," director Paul Moore said. "The main
thing is that he cruises down safely."
</P>
<P>
The landing looked perfect.
</P>
<P>
Jon Karkow, chief engineer for Scaled Composites, the company that designed
and built the plane, said Fossett did an excellent job
of bringing the plane down. It had about 1,100 pounds
of fuel left, enough to fly about another 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
The GlobalFlyer was leaking a little hydraulic fluid, Karkow said, and
had a few bugs on it. Other than that, it
appeared to be in perfect shape, he said.
</P>
<P>
The mission was sponsored by Virgin Atlantic, a British airline founded
by Richard Branson. Branson greeted Fossett on Thursday with a
hug and a bottle of champagne, which Branson began spraying
on Fossett. Fossett grabbed the bottle, sprayed his friend back
and took a chug.
</P>
<P>
Fossett holds world records in five sports, including ballooning and sailing.
Branson has been his partner in some of them.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters near the GlobalFlyer, Fossett said that
the fuel situation had concerned him, that but he had
run into similar problems before.
</P>
<P>
He said he liked "things that are difficult to do" and
loved technology projects.
</P>
<P>
"I would do these things if no one were paying attention,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked what kind of contribution his feat had made to
mankind, he said he wasn't sure it had made any.
</P>
<P>
"I know Richard Branson doesn't agree with me. He thinks there's
an important technological contribution in this," Fossett said. "I think
it's more in the lifestyle itself. I like going out
and doing things that are interesting to me, and I
think other people should do what is interesting to them."
</P>
<P>
The Global Flyer left Salina at 6:47 p.m. Monday. It weighed
4,000 pounds and carried 18,100 pounds of fuel. On Wednesday
morning, Mission Control directors announced that 2,600 pounds of fuel
had mysteriously disappeared. They said the fuel shortage put the
world record in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday evening, however, the directors were more optimistic. And, as
it turned out, the GlobalFlyer appears to have had fuel
to spare.
</P>
<P>
When asked Thursday morning whether the fuel situation had been overplayed
to gain publicity, Branson said the concern was real.
</P>
<P>
"Incredibly, the thing is, in life truth is often stranger than
fiction," he said.
</P>
<P>
NASA astronaut Ken Cockrell of Houston, whose last space mission was
in 2002, was intrigued enough by the mission to spend
the week in Salina. He was enthusiastic about it to
the end.
</P>
<P>
"In every human heart there is a desire to explore," Cockrell
said, as he waited on the runway Thursday for Fossett
to touch down.
</P>
<P>
"Some people like to explore things in a very small niche
of their environment. Others, like Steve, want to explore things
no one else has ever done."
