round-the-world flight

<P>
Exhaustion began to set in as 
American adventurer Steve Fossett reached the final legs of his epic 
bid at the first solo, non-stop non-refueled flight around the 
world, which he is confident he will complete despite some loss of 
fuel. 
</P>
<P>
When asked how he felt after his second full day of flying, 
Fossett late Wednesday told reporters via satellite phone: "It feels 
like three days."
</P>
<P>
"I've gotten minimal naps while keeping my eyes on the 
instruments," he added, explaining that because of the west-to-east 
direction he is flying, he "had to do four nights in a two and a 
half day trip."
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old millionaire had a stressful night after the 
Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer support team at Mission Control here 
discovered that he had 2,600 pounds (1,181 kilograms) less fuel than 
expected. The 3,350-pound (1,522-kilo) single-engine aircraft lifted 
off from here with 18,100 pounds (8,210 kilos) of fuel on Monday.
</P>
<P>
For much of the day there were concerns that Fossett would have 
to abort the mission and land in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
But by 04:00 GMT Thursday, Fossett and his crew determined that 
he had sufficient fuel to continue onward.
</P>
<P>
"The jet stream has been extraordinary. That allowed me to make 
up some time. In addition I've practiced fuel conservation." Fossett 
said. "I have every hope of making it to Salina."
</P>
<P>
Fossett said he was happy to hear that he had already broken one 
record: the longest non-stop distance traveled by a jet airplane.
</P>
<P>
He sounded personally touched to hear about the vast public 
interest his journey had generated. On launch, the mission's Web 
site, www.virginatlanticglobalflyer.com, received 2.8 million hits. 
Between 04:00 GMT Wednesday and 04:00 GMT Thursday, the site 
received 76 million hits.
</P>
<P>
While the cause of the fuel loss has not been determined, 
organizers said it was possible that fuel evaporated or escaped or 
that more fuel than expected was used during takeoff.
</P>
<P>
The plane had never flown before with full tanks and some fuel 
may have spilled out through a venting system used to maintain 
adequate pressure in the tanks, organizers said. A leak is unlikely, 
they added, as the fuel loss ceased after the first few hours of 
flight.
</P>
<P>
The plane's four main tanks are equipped with sensors, but not 
the additional tanks in the wings, where it was impossible to detect 
a possible leak until they began draining into the main boom tanks.
</P>
<P>
By the time Fossett reached Hawaii the wing tanks had begun to 
drain and it appeared there were no further fuel losses, said 
project manager Paul Moore.
</P>
<P>
Organizers are now hopeful that Fossett will be able to make it 
back to Salina by Thursday midday (around 18:00 GMT) if tailwinds 
remain strong. The plane was equipped at takeoff with 15 percent 
more fuel than it was expected to use.
</P>
<P>
It also has a strong glide capacity and could make the last 200 
miles (325 kilometers) on an empty tank if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said that given the current fuel situation, Fossett should 
be able to land with fuel to spare. 
</P>
<P>
However, Moore cautioned that a number of problems could arise 
in the coming hours to force Fossett to abort the flight.
</P>
<P>
"Some things have gone in Steve's favor in the last few hours," 
he said. "But Steve and the Global Flyer are close to the limits of 
their endurance." 
</P>
<P>
An unscheduled landing would not pose a risk, Moore said. 
"Although Steve required a huge runway to takeoff, there are a 
number of airstrips that Steve can safely land on," he said.
</P>
<P>
At 0930 GMT Thursday, Fossett was flying over the Pacific Ocean, 
1,151 miles (1852) kilometers southwest of California, at an 
elevation of 46,282 feet (14,107 meters) and a speed of 255 miles 
per hour (410 kilometers per hour). He had been flying for more than 
53 hours.
</P>
<P>
The three-day journey is a severe test of endurance and piloting 
abilities for Fossett, who has set dozens of world records with jet 
airplanes and gliders, hot air balloons and sailing.
</P>
<P>
The attempt is being bankrolled by Virgin Atlantic founder and 
entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson, who has set a number of aviation 
and sailing records of his own.
</P>
<P>
The GlobalFlyer was designed by aviation legend Burt Rutan, who 
recently made headlines when his SpaceShipOne won the 10 million 
dollar "X Prize" for sending a privately-designed craft into space 
twice in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Rutan also designed the Voyager, which was used by his brother 
Dick Rutan and Jeanne Yeager in 1986 to fly around the world without 
stopping or refueling in nine days.
</P>
<P>
Fossett hopes to beat that record by making it in less than 80 
hours, and by doing it on his own.
