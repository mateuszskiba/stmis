American adventurer Steve 
Fossett, seeking to make the first solo flight around the globe 
without refueling, is running low on fuel but will fly at least as 
far as Hawaii before deciding whether to continue, officials said 
Wednesday.

"I'm pleased to say that based on the information provided to 
him by the team here at Mission Control, Steve has decided that he 
will fly at least as far as Hawaii," Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer 
project manager Paul Moore told reporters.

<P>
"He will then make a further decision at that stage as to 
whether he feels comfortable and confident to fly beyond Hawaii 
towards the west coast of the US," he added.
</P>
<P>
Fossett is running low on fuel and Mission Control had been 
considering whether to abort the flight in Hawaii or have the plane 
turn back towards Japan.
</P>
<P>
At 2000 GMT on Wednesday, Fossett was east of Japan flying over 
the Pacific towards Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
He took off from an airport here on Monday and is hoping to 
touch down in Salina on Thursday, becoming the first person ever to 
make a solo non-stop, non-refueled flight around the world.
