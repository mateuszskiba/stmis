American adventurer Steve 
Fossett said Wednesday he may be forced to abort his mission to 
circle the globe without stopping after experiencing significant 
fuel loss on takeoff.
</P>
<P>
Fossett called the previously undetected loss of an extra 2,600 
pounds (1,181 kilograms) of fuel "a huge setback."
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a very high level of confidence at this point," 
Fossett told reporters from his plane, adding: "I'm going to do the 
best I can."
</P>
<P>
Fossett said he would have to maintain a tailwind speed of 67 
miles (180 kilometers) per hour, the average up to now, to finish 
his attempt.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Fossett passed the halfway point in his 
effort to make the first solo, non-stop flight around the world 
without refueling and with almost no sleep.
</P>
<P>
Fossett took off from this Midwestern US state on Monday and was 
to return here Thursday morning after spending between 60 and 80 
hours in the air. The 3,350-pound (1,522-kilo) single-engine 
aircraft was to burn nearly 19,000 pounds (8,636 kilos) of fuel.
</P>
<P>
The attempt is being bankrolled by Virgin Atlantic founder and 
entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson, who has set a number of aviation 
and sailing records of his own.
