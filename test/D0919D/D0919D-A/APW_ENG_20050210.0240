Prince Charles to marry Camilla

<P>
Prince Charles is to marry his partner Camilla Parker Bowles, the prince's
office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Clarence House didn't immediately announce further details, but Sky News TV
reported that the heir to the throne would marry on April 6.
</P>
<P>
Charles was previously married to Princess Diana, who died in a car crash in
Paris in 1997. She was divorced from Charles when she died.
</P>
<P>
Charles dated Camilla many years before he married Diana in 1981. They remained
friends but Diana blamed Charles' relationship with Parker Bowles, who was also
married, for the failure of their union.
</P>
<P>
"There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded," Diana said
in a 1995 TV interview.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Prince Charles admitted in a TV documentary that he had strayed from
his marriage vows, but insisted the infidelity happened only after the marriage
was "irretrievably broken down, us both having tried."
</P>
<P>
The pair divorced in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The marriage is a sensitive issue because Parker Bowles is divorced and her
former husband is still alive. Charles would be the supreme governor of the
Church of England if he took the throne, and some Anglicans remain opposed to
remarriage of divorcees.
</P>
<P>
The church is officially neutral on the issue, but former Archbishop of
Canterbury George Carey recently urged the couple to marry.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a poll indicated that more Britons support Prince Charles marrying
Camilla Parker Bowles than oppose it. Thirty-two percent of respondents to the
Populus poll said they would support Charles if he remarried, while 29 percent
were opposed. Thirty-eight percent said they didn't care and 2 percent had no
opinion.
