"I am pleased that Prince Charles and Mrs. Camilla Parker Bowles have decided to
take this important step," said the archbishop, who is the spiritual leader of
the Anglican communion.

The communion includes the Church of England, of which Charles is expected to
become Supreme Governor when he succeeds Queen Elizabeth II as British
monarch.

"I hope and pray that it will prove a source of comfort and strength to them and
to those who are closest to them," Williams said in a statement.

Charles announced he would marry Camilla in a civil ceremony at Windsor Castle
on April 8. Charles and Camilla are both divorcees.

Williams said he approved of the proposals.

"These arrangements have my strong support and are consistent with Church of
England guidelines concerning remarriage which the Prince of Wales fully accepts
as a committed Anglican and as prospective Supreme Governor of the Church of
England," Williams said.
