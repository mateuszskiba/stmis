Prince Charles and his longtime lover Camilla Parker Bowles _ both divorcees _

service.

"The wedding will be a largely private occasion for family and friends. There
will be a civil ceremony in Windsor Castle," said Clarence House, Charles'
residence and office. "There will subsequently be a service of prayer and
dedication in St. George's Chapel at which the Archbishop of Canterbury will
preside."
