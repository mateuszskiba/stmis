Camilla will pick up a string of titles as Charles' wife _ but not queen

<P>
She may not become queen, but Camilla Parker Bowles will be bona fide royalty
because of three key letters: HRH.
</P>
<P>
That designation stands for Her Royal Highness and is highly prized because it
means the bearer is officially a member of the inner sanctum of the royal
family.
</P>
<P>
When she weds Charles, Parker Bowles will acquire a slew of titles _ the main
one being HRH Duchess of Cornwall. In Scotland, she will be the Duchess of
Rothesay.
</P>
<P>
However, she will not be known as the Princess of Wales, a title which for many
people worldwide still conjures up memories of the prince's popular first wife,
the late Diana.
</P>
<P>
If Charles eventually becomes king, Parker Bowles will be known as HRH Princess
Consort _ but not Queen Camilla.
</P>
<P>
That decision was made by the couple themselves, Charles's Clarence House office
said, and was not imposed on them because of Parker Bowles' divorcee
status.
</P>
<P>
Princess Diana lost her HRH status when she was divorced _ a point that rankled
greatly with her and was criticized both by the public and the
press.
</P>
<P>
In 1936, when King Edward VIII abdicated to marry the American divorcee Wallis
Simpson and they became the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, he is said to have been
deeply angry and hurt that the HRH was withheld from his wife.
</P>
<P>
As the royal family modernizes, there are likely to be fewer
HRHs.
</P>
<P>
Charles' younger brother, Prince Edward, announced in 2003 that his newborn
daughter would not receive the HRH, nor would any more children he and his wife,
Sophie, might have.
</P>
<P>
Every wife of a reigning king has been known as Queen Consort except Queen Mary
II who was joint sovereign with King William III. She was Queen in her own right
and together they reigned from 1689 to 1694.
