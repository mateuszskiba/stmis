<P>
So ends years of tabloid and taxicab speculation.
</P>
<P>
In a surprise announcement, Britain's heir to the throne, Prince
Charles, declared on Thursday that he will marry his lover, Camilla
Parker Bowles, in a spring ceremony at Windsor Castle.
</P>
<P>
Parker Bowles will never become Queen Camilla, nor will she take
over the title of princess of Wales that was bestowed on her
predecessor, Diana, whose marriage to Charles ended in divorce, partly
over her. Diana died a year later, along with her boyfriend, in a
Paris car accident.
</P>
<P>
Instead, in a sort of constitutional compromise, Parker Bowles, 57,
will receive the title her royal highness the duchess of Cornwall. If
Charles becomes king, she will be called her royal highness the
princess consort. ``Those are the only royal titles that have been
confirmed so far,'' said a spokesperson for the prince of Wales.
</P>
<P>
Britain, which in 1936 forced Charles' great-uncle to abdicate the
throne in order to marry an American divorcee, barely batted an
eyelash at the consequence of the impending nuptials.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair wished the couple ``every happiness'' on
behalf of himself and his Cabinet. Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan
Williams, who serves as spiritual leader of the Anglican Church, said,
``I am pleased that Prince Charles and Mrs. Camilla Parker Bowles have
decided to take this important step.''
</P>
<P>
The announcement came in the form of a brief, formal statement from
the prince's household, which read, ``It is with great pleasure that
the marriage of HRH the prince of Wales and Mrs. Camilla Parker Bowles
is announced. It will take place on Friday 8th April, 2005, at Windsor
Castle.''
</P>
<P>
Later, Charles issued a statement that said, ``Mrs. Parker Bowles
and I are absolutely delighted. It will be a very special day for us
and our families.''
</P>
<P>
Queen Elizabeth gave the union her royal blessing. ``The duke of
Edinburgh and I are very happy that the prince of Wales and Mrs.
Parker Bowles are to marry. We have given them our warmest good wishes
for their future together.''
</P>
<P>
The 56-year-old prince's two sons, Prince Edward and Prince Harry,
announced that they too were delighted at the news of their father's
marriage.Although the marriage will cause little political
repercussion around Britain, the news dominated the airwaves Thursday.
Discussions and surveys showed general acceptance of the marriage but
strong reservations about Charles' new wife becoming ``Queen
Camilla.''
</P>
<P>
The memory of Diana, mother of his two sons, is still strong among
the British public, for whom Parker Bowles is the spoiler of what
began as a fairy-tale marriage.
</P>
<P>
Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, a onetime nursery school teacher,
were wed in 1981. Their marriage was made in tabloid heaven, their
every move scrutinized and documented in pictures by eager paparazzi.
But it was also marked by widespread speculation about unhappiness and
by questions of infidelity.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the tabloid press published a transcript of a taped call
between Charles and Parker Bowles, then the wife of a British
brigadier general. Among the lovers' words was a wish by the prince
that he become a tampon in order to remain close to Camilla.
</P>
<P>
Charles' relationship with Camilla began about 35 years ago when
they met at a polo match on the grounds of Windsor Castle. They
continued seeing each other throughout Charles' tumultuous marriage to
Diana, and the relationship was said by Diana to be the cause of her
eventual breakup with the prince. ``There were three of us in this
marriage -- so it was a bit crowded,'' she said in a famous TV
interview.
</P>

</P>
<P>
From the beginning, it was clear Parker Bowles shared Charles'
sporting life more than Diana.
</P>
<P>
Since the early days of his marriage to Diana, Charles was clearly
more at home on the back of a horse or shooting grouse and fishing for
salmon than on a dance floor, listening to pop music or watching
ballet, which were among the favorite pastimes of his young bride.
</P>
<P>
Charles and Parker Bowles were often seen fox hunting together or
on the polo field, where Charles was a regular player. Many of their
public outings have been on horseback.
</P>
<P>
Charles and Diana divorced in 1996. Diana, as princess of Wales,
found her calling as a patron of myriad charities, particularly those
supporting sick and disadvantaged children and old people. She
championed AIDS victims and traveled to war-torn and poverty stricken
countries, visiting orphanages and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Her death in a car accident in Paris in August 1997, along with
boyfriend Dodi Fayed, provoked an outpouring of grief in Britain and
abroad, forcing Charles and Parker Bowles to keep their relationship
in the background for some time.
</P>
<P>
Gradually the couple began appearing together in public in
carefully choreographed events.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The decision to marry comes as what many see as a logical
conclusion to a difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
``I don't think the public is hostile to the remarriage,'' says
Sarah Richardson , a constitutional historian at Warwick University.
``What does surprise me is the recognition of her role as princess
consort, which will put her in a spotlight where she will have to
deliver and be an active supporter of Charles almost on a par with
Diana.''
</P>
<P>
Relief rather than pleasure was expressed by many Britons
interviewed Thursday by TV networks.
</P>
<P>
``I guess it was better that they got married rather than not,''
said Marianne McElwee, 24, a Web site manager.
</P>
<P>
``I'm not keen on her,'' McElwee added. ``After all, Charles was
always in a relationship with her before he met Diana and he went on
seeing her after that, which didn't make Diana very happy.''
</P>
<P>
Although the acceptance of a king-to-be, himself divorced, with a
divorcee wife, is indicative of the changing face of Britain, the
announcement also forces official recognition of the flawed and human
side of royalty.
</P>
<P>
Royal marriages must be approved on several levels, so Blair's
statement of approval was essential. Charles' marriage will also need
an Act of Parliament before the wedding day -- virtually a foregone
conclusion in this case.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The spring wedding will be a civil service followed by a service of
prayer and dedication in the chapel of St. George at Windsor Castle.
No details were disclosed Thursday other than that the archbishop had
agreed to celebrate the religious ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The couple will spend their honeymoon in Scotland on the royal
estate of Birkhall, where Charles is said often to have taken refuge
from the public and media glare.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday evening, the couple attended a gala dinner at Windsor
Castle to support one of Prince Charles's charities.
</P>
<P>
Attention was focused on the prince's bride-to-be wearing her
engagement ring for the first time -- a diamond and platinum heirloom
reportedly from the prince's grandmother, the queen mother, who was
101 years old when she died in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The smiling Camilla, dressed in a glittering red floor-length dress
and a double string of pearls, told waiting crowds that the prince had
proposed to her on bended knee. ``I'm just coming down to earth,'' she
said, flashing the ring for photographers.
</P>
<P>
Charles, garbed in a tuxedo with a red collar and cuffs, told the
assembled reporters, ``I am very happy.''
</P>
<P>
The couple were applauded by their guests and posed, grinning
broadly, in front of the press before joining the party.
