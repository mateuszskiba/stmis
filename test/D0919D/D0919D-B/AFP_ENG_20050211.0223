Britain's Prince Charles and 
bride-to-be Camilla Parker Bowles kept a low profile Friday as they 
began their two-month engagement ahead oftic, very exciting and good fun," 
White told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Both restaurants and souvenir shops were likely to profit from 
the surge in interest, she added.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent bid to counter public criticism of their match, 
the couple have opted for a modest, private ceremony, and announced 
that Parker Bowles will not be queen once Charles takes the throne.
</P>
<P>
The British public remains deeply loyal to Diana eight years 
after her death in a car crash in Paris, and have shown mixed 
feelings about Charles' wedding to the woman whom Diana blamed for 
the breakup of her marriage.
</P>
<P>
Parker Bowles will not take on Diana's former title, the 
Princess of Wales, but will be known after the marriage as the 
Duchess of Cornwall instead. Once Charles becomes king she will be 
known as the Princess Consort.
</P>
<P>
The fact the wedding ceremony itself will be a civil affair is a 
nod to the Church of England, which does not permit divorcees to 
marry again in church. Both the prince, who as king will be titular 
head of the Church of England, and Parker Bowles are divorced.
</P>
<P>
Although marrying a long-term mistress is unorthodox for a 
British prince, there are no constitutional barriers.
</P>
<P>
Far more troublesome for the couple will be winning over the 
public. Diana, describing her breakup with Charles and divorce in 
1996, famously quipped that "there were three of us in this marriage 
so it was a bit crowded".
</P>
<P>
The announcement marks the culmination of a slow but steady 
transition for the couple, from avoiding being seen together for 
years to appearing at public events as a couple, and now marriage.
</P>
<P>
Charles first met Parker Bowles in 1970, but their relationship 
ended when he entered the navy and she married another suitor, army 
officer Andrew Parker Bowles.
</P>
<P>
Although this first marriage lasted until 1995, Parker Bowles 
continued to see the prince during his stormy marriage to Diana.
