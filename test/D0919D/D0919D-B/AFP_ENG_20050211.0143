<P>
Britain's Prince Charles and 
Camilla Parker Bowles embarked Friday on a two-month engagement 
ahead of their wedding at Windsor Castle where eager merchants were 
expecting a boost for business.
</P>
<P>
The wedding of the heir to the British throne will make official 
a longtime relationship notorious for its role in ending his 
marriage to the late Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
Though the planned union has met with a sometimes cool, even 
hostile public response, it was welcomed by the often unsentimental 
and tough tabloid press, and pundits predict Britons will eventually 
warm to the relationship.
</P>
<P>
In a first public appearance following the announcement on 
Thursday, the couple appeared at Windsor Castle, the royal family's 
residence just west of London and the venue for their civil wedding 
on April 8.
</P>
<P>
A beaming Parker Bowles sported a full-length fuschia evening 
gown and a platinum diamond engagement ring -- a royal heirloom -- 
and said Charles had proposed to her on bended knee.
</P>
<P>
The engagement, which gained public approval from Charles' 
mother Queen Elizabeth II and his sons, princes William and Harry, 
was feted at Windsor with a gala dinner for 250 guests.
</P>
<P>
The event will likely make shopkeepers happy. An assistant at a 
sovenir shop, Deep Basra, said: "We think it's going to be good for 
business. That's why we opened early today."
</P>
<P>
In an apparent bid to counter public criticism of their match, 
the couple have opted for a modest, private ceremony, and announced 
that Parker Bowles will not be queen once Charles takes the throne.
</P>
<P>
Clarence House, the prince's London residence, said the wedding 
would be "a largely private occasion for family and friends", in 
marked contrast to Charles's sumptuous public wedding to Diana at 
St. Paul's Cathedral in 1981.
</P>
<P>
The British public remains deeply loyal to Diana eight years 
after her death, in a car crash in Paris, and have shown mixed 
feelings about Charles' wedding to the woman whom she blamed for the 
breakup of her marriage.
</P>
<P>
Parker Bowles will not take on Diana's former title, the 
Princess of Wales, but will be known after the marriage as the 
Duchess of Cornwall instead. Once Charles becomes king she will be 
known as the Princess Consort, instead of queen.
</P>
<P>
The fact the wedding ceremony itself will be a civil affair is a 
nod to the Church of England, which does not recognize marriage 
between divorcees. Both the 56-year-old prince, who as king will be 
titular head of the Church of England, and Parker Bowles, 57, are 
divorced.
</P>
<P>
The Anglican head, Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, 
voiced approval of the union, saying it was "consistent with Church 
of England guidelines concerning remarriage".
</P>
<P>
Although marrying a long-term mistress is highly unorthodox for 
a British prince, there are no constitutional barriers.
</P>
<P>
Far more troublesome for the couple will be winning over the 
British public.
</P>
<P>
arriage had fallen apart" -- a reference to the princess's own 
romantic affairs.
</P>
<P>
A poll published Friday in the Daily Telegraph showed 65 percent 
felt Charles and Parker Bowles should be married, compared with 24 
percent who were against it.
