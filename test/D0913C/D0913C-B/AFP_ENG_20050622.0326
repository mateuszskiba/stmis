Judgment Day looms for US Supreme Court on Ten Commandments 
cases

WASHINGTON, June 22

<TEXT>
<P>
The US political, religious and 
legal establishments are braced for two critical Supreme Court 
rulings on the Ten Commandments, weighing heavily on the separation 
of church and state.
</P>
<P>
The decision, expected as early as Thursday, could inflame 
conservative evangelical groups or opposing civil liberties lobbies, 
and thrust the court squarely into partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
And both sides of the divide will use whatever judgment day 
brings in the two cases to whip up partisans ahead of a looming 
battle over what could be imminent vacancies on the court bench.
</P>
<P>
Each case is born out of the religious and cultural struggle 
raging in modern America between radical evangelicals and advocates 
of the secular state.
</P>
<P>
The conservative religious right, a strong backer of President 
George W. Bush, argues that the country is a "Christian" state and 
decry attempts to deny that heritage.
</P>
<P>
Civil liberties advocates however fear a tide of evangelical 
Christianity is eroding the politically sacred separation of church 
and state, and endangering the principle that all Americans, 
whatever their religion, are created equal.
</P>
<P>
The more contentious question before the court, legal experts 
say, is a challenge to the display of framed copies in two Kentucky 
courthouses of the Ten Commandments, which Christians and Jews 
believe God handed to Moses on Mount Sinai.
</P>
<P>
"This case will answer whether or not the government may hew to 
a particular religious viewpoint and chose Christianity because 
there have been Christians in our heritage," said Marci Hamilton of 
the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, Yeshiva University.
</P>
<P>
"Or whether the Supreme Court is going to take the heat, which 
it is going to get, and say there are some circumstances where the 
government cannot post the Ten Commandments despite their importance 
in our history and they must make it clear that every citizen is a 
citizen that is equal in the eyes of the law."
</P>
<P>
The second case surrounds the legality of a stone monument 
inscribed with the commandments and other religious symbols on the 
grounds of the Texas state legislature.
</P>
<P>
This may be easier to resolve than the Kentucky situation, as 
the monument was placed in a display of other historical monuments 
and was a private donation.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, justices could stake out a compromise position and 
argue that the display was not necessarily endorsed by the Texas 
state government, allowing it to fall within constitutional bounds.
</P>
<P>
The US Constitution's first amendment establishes the principle 
of separation of church and state, but how this should be 
interpreted remains unclear following numerous contradictory 
decisions by lower courts.
</P>
<P>
Justices may find a more delicate tightrope in the Kentucky 
case, as it was the government of McCreary County which put a plaque 
of the Ten Commandments in a courthouse, and defended the display 
through the courts.
</P>
<P>
It would be hard to argue therefore that the state government 
did not endorse the display, prompting some experts to believe the 
Supreme Court may come up with a split judgment on the Texas and 
Kentucky cases.
</P>
<P>
Differences over the cases were clear when the court took up the 
questions in March.
</P>
<P>
Appearing to endorse the displays, conservative justice Antonin 
Scalia called them "the symbol that government derives its authority 
from God."
</P>
<P>
"I see nothing wrong with the government reflecting that. We're 
a tolerant society," Scalia said.
</P>
<P>
Liberal justice Stephen Breyer however countered that, although 
the US is a highly religious country, "we are also committed to 
secularism."
