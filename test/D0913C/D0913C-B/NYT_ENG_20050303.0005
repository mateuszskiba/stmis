TEXAS CASE BEFORE U.S. SUPREME COURT COULD REDEFINE CHURCH, STATE; JUSTICES WEIGHING HISTORICAL TIES VS. ENDORSING RELIGION

<P>
Supreme Court justices voiced concern Wednesday during arguments in
a lawsuit over a Ten Commandments monument in Austin, Texas,
that efforts to preserve separation of church and state could
reach a "hostility toward religion."
</P>
<P>
Justices seemed to grapple for a standard that would keep government
from endorsing a particular religion, without eradicating America's historical and
cultural ties to religion in a case brought by Thomas
Van Orden, a Texas man who said he was offended
by the display of the biblical edicts on the Capitol
grounds.
</P>
<P>
That case, along with a companion lawsuit from Kentucky argued Wednesday,
could result in a far-reaching new definition of when it
is appropriate for words or symbols with religious content to
be displayed in courthouses, schools and other public buildings.
</P>
<P>
Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, making his first-ever argument before the
Supreme Court, said that the commandments should be seen as
a "recognized symbol of law" and not as an endorsement
by the state of a particular religion.
</P>
<P>
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor noted that the high court had already
decided that Congress and state legislatures can begin their day
with a prayer. "It is so hard to draw that
line if the legislature can open its session with a
prayer but can't display the Ten Commandments" on the statehouse
grounds, she said.
</P>
<P>
Justice Anthony Kennedy worried that efforts to extinguish all religious displays
on government property were "obsessive" and could amount to a
"hostility toward religion" by the high court.
</P>
<P>
He wondered aloud why someone who was offended by the words
of the commandments couldn't simply look away.
</P>
<P>
Erwin Chemerinsky, a Duke University law professor who argued the case
for Van Orden, told the justices, "This monument, standing alone,
does convey the state's endorsement of religion." And, as for
nonbelievers simply ignoring the monument, Chemerinsky said, it wasn't that
simple.
</P>
<P>
The display created an atmosphere where "some feel like insiders and
some feel like outsiders."
</P>
<P>
At issue is a red granite monument donated to Texas in
1961 by the Fraternal Order of the Eagles. That group
donated hundreds of the commandment statues to state and local
governments all across America.
</P>
<P>
The Austin case reached the high court on appeal after a
lower court ruled the monument did not violate the so-called
Establishment Clause in the Constitution, which says, "Congress shall make
no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the
free exercise thereof."
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, more than two dozen courts have ruled on displays
of the Ten Commandments in government settings. Those cases have
created a contradictory legal thicket that the justices seemed eager
to cut through with a decisive ruling.
</P>
<P>
But if consensus was emerging among the justices on a formula
that would achieve that goal, it was not evident during
questioning Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Abbott, 47, was grilled by the justices as he argued that
the Austin monument should be seen as part of the
"museum-like" display of Lone Star history on the grounds that
also includes tributes to the Alamo, Texas pioneer women, Confederate
veterans and others.
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased we were able to get across to the
court our message that what the monument does is acknowledge
religion's role in state history without endorsing religion," Abbott said
after the session ended.
</P>
<P>
Asked how he thought the state would fare when an opinion
is delivered by the court sometime later this year, he
said, "I realize that you can't make predictions based on
comments from the bench."
</P>
<P>
Van Orden, who brought the case, declined to be interviewed Wednesday.
He was in Texas as the case was argued.
</P>
<P>
Some justices seemed skeptical of Abbott's argument that the Ten Commandments
were not basically a religious expression. And surrounding the commandments
with other memorials didn't necessarily change the message being sent
to the public. "It would be crazy law from this
court that said you can engage in religious (display) as
long as you hide the ball well enough," said Justice
David Souter.
</P>
<P>
As lawyers and justices debated, the image of Moses holding the
disputed tablets peered down from a vanilla marble frieze in
the chamber, part of a majestic tableau, including Hammurabi and
Confucius, honoring the development of law.
</P>
<P>
That portrayal of the commandments, in which some of the text
can be seen in Hebrew, served as a backdrop for
many of the questions Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers opposed to the Ten Commandments displayed in Austin and in
two Kentucky courthouses said the context of the Supreme Court
carving made it acceptable, but to have the commandments standing
alone sent a different message -- that there was a
state-sanctioned religion in America.
</P>
<P>
Justice Antonin Scalia noted that public opinion polls show at least
three quarters of Americans support the display of the Ten
Commandments. He asked why a minority opposed to the display
shouldn't be "tolerant of the majority."
</P>
<P>
The debate inside the high court unfolded as a more strident
war of words raged outside in the frigid March air.
Those passionately opposed to removing the statue and those just
as fervently committed to seeing it go held rallies, amid
cardboard commandments and signs noting, "Atheists Have Rights Too."
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Aubrey Vaughan, a pastor at Houston's Grace Baptist Church,
was carrying a stack of paper that contained 5,000 signatures
he'd collected since last year in support of the Ten
Commandments monument. "Support is overwhelming in Texas. Even people who
aren't very religious said the monument should stay. It doesn't
harm anybody," he said.
</P>
<P>
Eric Herrman of Millersville, Md., of the American Atheists, a group
supporting the rights of atheists, said, "As an atheist, I
feel like a second-class citizen. The government should not favor
any religion."
</P>
<P>
One possible narrow solution to the Texas case emerged during the
questioning when Justice John Paul Stevens suggested the state simply
add a disclaimer to the statue saying it was not
meant as an endorsement of religion.
</P>
<P>
Abbott said that disclaimer was already implied by the words on
the statue noting it was a gift from the Eagles,
and by the lack of a Texas state seal.
