<P>
The US Supreme Court heard arguments 
Wednesday on the constitutionality of displaying in public spaces 
the Ten Commandments, in a case on the officially mandated 
separation of church and state in US society.
</P>
<P>
While about 100 people from opposing groups protested outside 
the court, lawyers and court justices debated two challenges to the 
use of public property for displaying the commandments, fundamental 
moral precepts Jews and Christians believe God gave to Moses on 
Mount Sinai.
</P>
<P>
In the coming weeks, the court is expected to decide under what 
conditions, if at all, such displays are permitted under the US 
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution's first amendment establishes the principle of 
separation of church and state, but how this should be interpreted 
remains unclear in the face of numerous contradictory decisions by 
courts over recent decades.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, the Supreme Court reviewed two cases, one a challenge 
to the display of framed copies of the Ten Commandments in two 
Kentucky courthouses, among other documents that form the basis of 
US laws.
</P>
<P>
The second addressed the legality of a stone monument inscribed 
with the commandments, nationalist and and other religious symbols 
installed on the grounds of the Texas state legislature.
</P>
<P>
The hearings were marked by intense discussion of the meaning of 
the Ten Commandments in US traditions, examining whether they are 
essentially religious edicts or cultural norms.
</P>
<P>
Defenders cited the example of the commandment "Thou shalt not 
kill" as demonstrating that they do not contradict or surmount 
secular laws.
</P>
<P>
However, justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg challenged that view by 
noting that other commandments are specifically religious, one 
requiring observation of the sabbath.
</P>
<P>
"Have you read the first four commandments?" she demanded of one 
of her colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Appearing to endorse the displays -- while noting most Americans 
could not recite the commandments -- conservative justice Antonin 
Scalia called them "the symbol that government derives its authority 
from God."
</P>
<P>
"I see nothing wrong with the government reflecting that. We're 
a tolerant society," Scalia said.
</P>
<P>
Liberal justice Stephen Breyer countered that, although the US 
is a highly religious country, "we are also committed to 
secularism."
</P>
<P>
The case has drawn extremely high interest from both religious 
groups and secular society advocates across the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Government supports Christianity, but we want it to be 
neutral," said Eric Heirman, who joined a group of atheists outside 
the court protesting against religious displays.
</P>
<P>
A young teenager, one of a group of people praying outside the 
court in support of the displays, argued to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
"I think religion has to be shown everywhere. I think people 
should start to believe," he said.
</P>
<P>
While there were no clear indications of how the justices might 
rule, arguments frequently returned to the issue of the context of 
the display, with justices making reference to the  73-year-old 
marble frieze in their own courtroom, which depicts Moses holding 
the commandments among numerous other historical figures of law.
</P>
<P>
The emphasis on context could possibly lead to the court 
avoiding making a categorical decision and instead ruling in favor 
of one of the displays and against the other.
