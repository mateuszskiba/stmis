JUSTICES EXAMINE 10 COMMANDMENTS CASE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON

<P>
A granite monument of the Ten Commandments outside the
Texas Capitol amounts to an unconstitutional government endorsement of religion,
a lawyer favoring a high wall between church and state
told the Supreme Court on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Arguments in the Texas case and a similar one from Kentucky
pose the question of whether and how the Ten Commandments
can be displayed on government property. Rulings in the cases
could decide the shape of church-state relations for decades to
come.
</P>
<P>
The high court's decisions -- probably issued by the end of
June -- could significantly raise or lower the wall separating
government and religion. In doing so, they could clarify decades
of confusing, muddled jurisprudence on what constitutes government endorsement of
religion.
</P>
<P>
In the Texas case, a homeless man filed suit challenging the
constitutionality of a 6-foot by 3-foot monument in the shape
of two tablets, inscribed with the Ten Commandments, two Stars
of David and other symbols.
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old granite monument -- one of 38 on the Texas
Capitol grounds in Austin -- was donated by the Fraternal
Order of Eagles. The tablets are located roughly 75 feet
from the Capitol building and 123 feet from the state
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Opponents say that because the monument is on the Capitol grounds
under the authority of the Texas legislature, it constitutes government
endorsement of Christianity -- and in particular Protestant faiths, from
which the display's Ten Commandments text is derived.
</P>
<P>
"Here you have a monument that claims not only is there
a God, but God has dictated 10 rules for behavior,"
said Erwin Chemerinsky, a lawyer for the Texas man who
wants the tablet removed. "Imagine the Buddhist or Muslim who
walks into the Supreme Court. He will realize this is
not his government."
</P>
<P>
But lawyers supporting the monument and other similar displays argued that
the Ten Commandments are a historically recognized symbol of law.
And they noted that in a 1983 case, the Supreme
Court found it was constitutional for a state legislature to
begin its session with prayer.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see why one is good and the other is
bad," said Justice Antonin Scalia.
</P>
<P>
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, often a swing vote when the justices
are closely divided, questioned how appropriate it would be if
"the legislature itself wants to have the Ten Commandments displayed
in its legislative halls."
</P>
<P>
When Chemerinsky said that would be unconstitutional, O'Connor complained "it's so
hard to draw that line."
</P>
<P>
If legislatures can open their sessions with prayers, O'Connor wondered how
displaying the Ten Commandments in the same hall could be
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
The Kentucky case involves the constitutionality of Ten Commandments displays in
two county courthouses. The displays have been modified twice in
response to lower court rulings against the exhibits.
</P>
<P>
The first ones consisted of a framed copy of the Ten
Commandments. In its current version, the Ten Commandments are surrounded
by historic American and British political and patriotic documents. A
description in the final displays asserts the exhibits are of
"documents that played a significant role in the foundation of
our system of law and government."
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the Kentucky exhibits argue county officials clearly had a
religious purpose in posting the Ten Commandments and that the
subsequent modifications were little more than a "sham" designed to
insulate the displays from scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
Justice David Souter said it seemed clear the displays were religious
in nature. "There's no reason the intent of this display
has changed as the context has changed," Souter said.
</P>
<P>
But supporters argue the court should not give too much weight
to the original intent of county officials in erecting the
displays.
</P>
<P>
Kentucky authorities were only trying "to do the best they could"
to follow previous court decisions, said Mathew Staver, who represented
the Kentucky counties. "They have got to be able to
adjust their missteps whenever they step on a constitutional land
mine that is blurry and confusing."
</P>
<P>
Acting Solicitor General Paul Clement, who represented the Bush administration in
defending the Texas and Kentucky displays, said "municipalities should be
rewarded, not punished, for trying to change the context to
try and get it right."
</P>
<P>
During the arguments Wednesday, justices appeared to struggle with how to
judge the Texas and Kentucky displays -- and whether a
single test could be constructed to decide when government-sponsored religious
exhibits or actions run afoul of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Justice Stephen Breyer doubted the high court could fashion a one-size-fits-all
solution.
</P>
<P>
"We are a religious nation," Breyer said. "I think the only
way to do it is to look at the divisive
quality of the display on a case-by-case basis."
</P>
<P>
Even as justices weighed the issue, they noted that religious symbols
are displayed throughout the Supreme Court building. Above the dais,
a large frieze depicts Moses holding the Ten Commandments --
without text displayed. Other historic lawgivers -- including Chinese philosopher
Confucius, Roman Emperor Caesar Augustus, and former Chief Justice John
Marshall -- also are depicted on the panel.
</P>
<P>
Supreme Court sessions also open with a clerk proclaiming: "God save
the United States and this honorable court."
