A suspected car bomb ripped through a hotel on the Red Sea coast of
Egypt's Sinai desert late Thursday, one of three explosions targeting
tourists that left at least 35 people dead and scores more wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israeli public television, citing a police source, said a car bomb
detonated close to the entrance of the Hilton Hotel in the resort of
Taba just across the border from Israel, destroying a large part of
the building.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the hotel blast, another two explosions rocked tourist
camps at Shitani and Ras Soltan which lie on the coast road of the
desert peninsula to the south of Taba.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian police source said the three explosions killed at least
35 people and left another 125 wounded. Earlier reports said at least
23 Israelis were killed in the Hilton blast.
</P>
<P>
The explosions occurred as Israelis were celebrating the end of the
Jewish holiday of Sukkot, and followed warnings from the country's
intelligence services that Israelis should keep out of the Sinai
desert.
</P>
<P>
"From the first information that we have received it could have been
a car bomb attack," a senior Israeli foreign ministry official told
AFP.
</P>
<P>
Hospital sources said the casualties were of different nationalities.
</P>
<P>
"I am standing in front of the hotel. I heard a big explosion about
30 minutes ago that smashed all the windows. The power went off," a
witness who gave his name as Eitan told Israeli radio.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian public television had said earlier that the Hilton blast was
caused by a gas leak.
</P>
<P>
The explosions came amid a massive Israeli army offensive in the
north of the Gaza Strip, a wedge of land near the border with Egypt,
that has left 93 Palestinians dead in less than 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Ambulances were seen shuttling across the border checkpoint between
Taba and the Israeli resort of Eilat, where hospital staff wheeled
bloodied victims on stretchers.
</P>
<P>
Resorts dotted along the Sinai's desert coast have remained popular
holiday spots for Israelis since the territory was handed back to
Egypt as part of a 1979 peace deal, the first between Israel and an
Arab country.
</P>
<P>
But Taba was excluded from Israel's 1982 handover of the Sinai and
was only returned in 1989 after years of wranging following a ruling
by the International Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Ties between the two neighbours have soured since the start of the
Palestinian intifada or uprising against Israeli occupation four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
But thousands of Israeli tourists are still drawn to the Sinai,
especially for its outstanding Red Sea diving and its hotel casinos,
banned in the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post reported on September 11, after the government
travel advisory, that vacationing Israelis were continuing to flock
to the Sinai, despite repeated and increasingly dire official
warnings of attacks.
</P>
<P>
"Because nothing has happened since previous warnings were issued,
the public seems to be treating advisories from counter-terrorism
experts and the foreign ministry as akin to the boy who cried wolf,"
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It estimated that over the past summer alone, around 300,000 Israelis
took holidays in Sinai, thus replacing Turkey as Israelis' most
popular tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
Avi Dichter, the head of Israel's Shin Beth domestic security agency,
told the cabinet on September 19 that prompt action had thwarted a
plot by Palestinian militants to strike Israeli tourists in the
Sinai.
</P>
<P>
Dichter said that the attack had been planned by the Palestinian
Islamist movement Hamas to coincide with the Jewish new year holidays
between September 15 and 18.
