Israel on Friday blamed Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda terror network for
a series of anti-Israeli bomb attacks against in Egypt's Sinai
peninsula that left at least 19 people dead and another 38 missing.
</P>
<P>
"According to our first information, it appears to be an
international terror attack with the hallmarks of Al-Qaeda," Israel's
deputy defence minister Zeev Boim said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom echoed the accusations and
told army radio: "Al-Qaeda threatens all the countries, including
Arab ones that according to it have close relations with Israel or
the Western world."
</P>
<P>
"This would explain the recent attacks in Morocco, Istanbul or
Riyadh," Shalom said of a series of deadly bombings in those cities.
</P>
<P>
"The struggle against terrorism is worldwide and we are far from
having won it because organisations, not States, are behind it."
</P>
<P>
The attacks occurred late Thursday as the Red Sea coast of the
southern Sinai was packed with Israeli holidaymakers celebrating the
final day of the Jewish festival of Sukkot.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month Al-Qaeda number two Ayman al-Zawahiri called on
young Muslims to attack Israeli, Western and Asian interests across
the world, specifically mentioning Egypt.
</P>
<P>
"It's the era of Muslim resistance, after the (Arab) governments
submitted to the Zionist occupant. We should learn the lesson of
Chechnya, Afghanistan, of Iraq, of Palestine," a voice attributed to
Zawahiri said on a tape aired by Al-Jazeera on October 1.
</P>
<P>
"Don't wait for the American, British, French, South Korean,
Hungarian and Polish forces to enter Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula,
Yemen and Algeria to start the resistance," the speaker added. "We
should start the resistance from now."
</P>
<P>
Zawahiri, a 53-year-old Egyptian surgeon, is  bin Laden's right-hand
man and reportedly his personal physician.
</P>
<P>
He was last heard in a videotape broadcast by the Qatar-based news
channel on September 9 in which he forecast a US defeat in Iraq and
Afghanistan, and there had been unconfirmed rumours that he may have
been killed.
</P>
<P>
But a US intelligence official said then that CIA analysts had
concluded that the voice on the October 1 broadcast was indeed that
of Zawahiri.
