A group calling itself "Islamic Unity Brigades" claimed
responsibility Friday for a series of bombings in Egypt's Sinai
peninsula targeting Israeli tourists, and which Israel has blamed on
Al-Qaeda.

"Four of your martyrdom-seeking brothers (suicide bombers) carried
out this heroic operation... against a den of prostitution and
corruption," said a statement posted on an Islamist website whose
authenticity could not be confirmed.

<P>
The previously unknown group said the attack, which killed at least
19 people and left another 38 missing, was in revenge for Israel's
assassination last March of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, founder of the
Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, and was "the first direct shot
in the face of Jews."
