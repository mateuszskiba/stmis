PERSONAL BELIEFS WON'T DETERMINE RULINGS, NOMINEE SAYS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Roberts says his judicial rulings are determined solely
by legal reasoning, not his personal beliefs and values.
</P>
<P>
"Judges wear black robes because it doesn't matter who they are
as individuals," Roberts, President Bush's nominee for chief justice, told
the Senate Judiciary Committee. "That's not going to shape their
decision. It's their understanding of the law that will shape
their decision."
</P>
<P>
Roberts' portrait of the ideal judge -- the detached legal scholar,
operating on pure intellect -- raised a basic question about
the nature of judging. And it alarmed at least two
senators, who implored him not to leave his humanity behind
when he takes the bench.
</P>
<P>
"By becoming John Roberts the chief justice, don't ever forget to
be John Roberts the man," Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, told
Roberts at his confirmation hearing Wednesday. "When you put on
your black robe and assume your spot on the Supreme
Court, you will truly bring with you your heart and
your soul."
</P>
<P>
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., after hearing Roberts repeatedly refuse to state
his views on the Roe vs. Wade abortion-rights ruling and
other past decisions, said she was concerned about "John Roberts
the legal automaton."
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect you to say what you would do about
Roe ... but I do expect to know a little
bit more about how you feel and how you think,"
Feinstein said during Wednesday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
Roberts' self-portrait as a judge animated by legal reasoning, divorced from
personal beliefs, is the flip side of the stereotypical judicial
activist -- the judge who elevates personal views above the
law. Conservatives scornfully single out the late Chief Justice Earl
Warren, who would interrupt lawyers' recitations of legal precedents by
asking, "But is it fair?"
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, said Vikram Amar, a law professor at
UC Hastings in San Francisco, psychology and common sense dictate
that "who the person is has to affect how the
judge behaves."
</P>
<P>
One way to frame the issue is whether judges can retain
their humanity without losing sight of the law and becoming
politicians with gavels. Legal scholars offered varying assessments.
</P>
<P>
"There are going to be cases that judges will look at
differently because of the values and backgrounds they bring," said
Stanford Law Professor Pamela Karlan. "Otherwise, why didn't President Bush
just nominate some random smart federal judge?"
</P>
<P>
For example, she said, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who became the
court's first female justice when President Ronald Reagan appointed her
in 1981, graduated from Stanford Law School with honors but
couldn't get a job as a lawyer. That experience clearly
affected her sympathetic approach to sex discrimination cases, Karlan said.
</P>
<P>
Roberts "can't possibly mean it," Karlan said of his assertion that
personal values are irrelevant. "It's the kind of thing every
judge says, and everybody knows it's not completely true."
</P>
<P>
But John Yoo, a UC Berkeley law professor and a former
Bush administration Justice Department official, said Roberts wasn't really claiming
that he could, or should, close his eyes to all
personal experiences in his rulings.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Yoo said, Roberts was expressing a difficult but desirable goal
-- that judges should "try to put all prejudices, biases
and feelings aside and decide cases as neutrally as possible.
Otherwise, why not just have elections for judges?"
</P>
<P>
The classic case, Yoo said, involved Northern judges who ordered the
return of escaped slaves to their masters before the Civil
War, obeying the Fugitive Slave Law and overriding their consciences.
Though history applauds the judges who found ways around the
law, Yoo said, true judicial values require judges to follow
the law or resign from the bench.
</P>
<P>
Roberts used similarly absolutist terms when asked Tuesday by Sen. Charles
Grassley, R-Iowa, whether there was room for personal values in
constitutional interpretation.
</P>
<P>
"You don't look to your own values and beliefs," Roberts said.
"You look outside yourself to other sources."
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged at another point that "we all bring our life
experiences to the bench," but said the goal of all
judges should be to follow "the rule of law, not
their own preferences."
</P>
<P>
Under renewed questioning Wednesday, Roberts insisted that he didn't discard his
values when he became a judge.
</P>
<P>
"The cause I believe in passionately, the one to which I
have dedicated my career, is the vindication of the rule
of law," Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
Amar said Roberts appeared to be attempting to bolster the metaphor
he first used Monday of the judge as an umpire
calling balls and strikes. The comparison oversimplifies the judicial role
and ignores the effect of personal experience, Amar said.
</P>
<P>
Not all cases engage a judge's values, said Stanford's Karlan; for
example, the meaning of a disputed federal law may be
resolved by a grammatical inquiry. But she said other questions,
like the meaning of the constitutional guarantee of equal protection
of the law or the ban on cruel and unusual
punishment, may turn as much on judges' individual perspectives as
on their dissection of legal precedent.
</P>
<P>
For example, she said, the late liberal Justice William Brennan and
conservative Chief Justice William Rehnquist were "two smart, dedicated individuals
reaching different views, based on precisely the same (constitutional) language."
