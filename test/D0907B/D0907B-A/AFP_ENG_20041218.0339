A Justice Department lawyer wrote a secret memo to the White House in
2001 concluding that President George W. Bush has the authority to
wage preemptive war against terrorists and countries even if they
were not linked to the September 11 attacks, Newsweek magazine
reported Saturday.

<P>
According to the memo there are effectively "no limits" on the
presidents authority to wage war, Newsweek reports, noting that it
seems to lay the legal groundwork for Bush to invade Iraq even
without approval Congressional approval.

<P>
"The President may deploy military force preemptively against
terrorist organizations or the states that harbor or support them,
whether or not they can be linked to the specific terrorist incidents
of Sept. 11," the memo reads, according to Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
The memo, titled "The Presidents Constitutional Authority to Conduct
Military Operations against Terrorists and Nations Supporting Them,"
argues that the president should be allowed to order whatever
military action "in his best judgment" are necessary to protect the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The presidents decisions to use force "are for him alone and are
unreviewable," the memo reads.

<P>
The 15-page document, dated September 25, 2001, was written by
conservative Justice Department lawyer John Yoo and addressed to
White House counsel Alberto Gonzales. Yoo has since left government
and is a university law professor.

<P>
"There was a general awareness after Sept. 11 that the enemy was not
simply Al-Qaeda -- but militant Islam in general," Brad Berenson, who
served in the White House counsels office at the time, told Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
The memo was aimed at granting Bush authority to attack groups such
as the Abu Sayef rebels in the Philippines or the militant Shiite
Muslim group Hezbollah, Berenson told the magazine.
