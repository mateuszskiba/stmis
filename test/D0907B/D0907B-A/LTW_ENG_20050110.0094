Gonzales Witness Under Their Noses

Senate Judiciary Democrats and liberal allies have
been hoping for months to get their mitts on internal administration
documents relating to torture and prison abuses -- some of them
involving attorney general nominee Alberto Gonzales.
</P>
<P>
There's little or no chance they'll get any of them. The American
Civil Liberties Union, for example, last week listed CIA, Pentagon,
Justice Department and other memos and cables it wanted made public.
One item was described as a ``memorandum from James Ho,
attorney-advisor, (Justice Department) Office of Legal Counsel, to
John Yoo, deputy assistant attorney general, OLC, re: interpretation
of Geneva Conventions' Common Article 3 (Feb. 1, 2002).''
</P>
<P>
Most unlikely they'll find out what that one says. Besides, Ho and
Yoo have both left the department. Yoo is teaching law at Berkeley,
although Ho is said to be in this area.
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute! Who was that good-looking guy sitting behind Sen.
John Cornyn, R-Texas, during Gonzales's hearing on Thursday? Son of a
gun. It's James Ho, now Cornyn's chief counsel on the Constitution
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
Maybe the Judiciary Committee Dems ought to interview him?
