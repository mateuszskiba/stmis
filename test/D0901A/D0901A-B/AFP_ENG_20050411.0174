New Delhi, April 11

<P>
The moderate wing of Indian 
Kashmir's main separatist alliance said Monday it will meet Pakistan 
President Pervez Musharraff when he visits New Delhi this weekend, 
local media reported.
</P>
<P>
The All Party Hurriyat Confererence has been pushing for its 
inclusion in a formal peace proceess between nuclear rivals India 
and Pakistan aimed at ending the long festering dispute over the 
divided Himalayan region of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The Hurriyat said it would discuss Tuesday in Srinagar, the main 
city of Indian Kashmir, its strategy for the meeting with the 
Pakistani president, the Press Trust of India news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf is coming to New Delhi to watch the final one-day 
cricket match of a series between the two countries and meet Prime 
Minister Manmohan Singh to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We will be meeting Musharraf on April 16. This has been 
verbally communicated to us," the chairman of the moderate wing, 
Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, told the Press Trust of India. It gave no 
further details.
</P>
<P>
Both the moderate and hardline factions of Hurriyat have 
welcomed the peace process launched in January 2004 between the 
neighbours which have fought three wars, two over divided Kashmir 
that both claim in full.
</P>
<P>
But separatist leaders say at some point they must be included 
in the discussions on Kashmir's future in a "triangular dialogue." 
India, however, wants a bilateral solution while Pakistan wants the 
separatists' involvement.
</P>
<P>
Indian security forces have been fighting since 1989 to suppress 
a deadly revolt against New Delhi's rule in Indian Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani president said on the weekend he was more 
interested in discussing the future of Kashmir with Indian leaders 
than being a spectator at the cricket game set for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf's trip will just come just over a week after the 
launch of a historic bus service linking the Indian and Pakistan 
zones of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf has said the bus service cannot resolve the Kashmir 
issue but is a "step towards confidence building".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, The Hindu newspaper quoted Farooq as saying he wants 
to take the bus to meet Kashmiri leaders in Pakistan-administered 
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"A sincere political dialogue should start now between the 
political leaders on both sides ... and a visit by Hurriyat leaders 
would go a long way in the convergence of ideas for an amicable 
solution," he said.
</P>
<P>
India invited Musharraf to attend one of the matches on 
Pakistan's first full tour of India in six years after the Pakistani 
leader said he wanted to watch a cricket match in India.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf's visit to India will be the first since a summit in 
the northern city of Agra in 2001 with then prime minister Atal 
Behari Vajpayee collapsed over Kashmir dispute.
