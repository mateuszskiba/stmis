More weddings than funerals: Kashmir enjoys nights out after a generation of violence

<P>
Of all the signs the India-Pakistan peace process is producing tangible
dividends, one stands out: Kashmir is running low on chickens.
</P>
<P>
Chickens are the key ingredient in the traditional Kashmiri wedding feast, and
with the Indian-Pakistan peace process producing the region's most peaceful
summer since the start of Kashmir's Islamic insurgency in 1989, this year's
wedding season is among the most festive in years.
</P>
<P>
Kashmir lies at the heart of the India-Pakistan rivalry _ the neighbors have
fought two wars over the predominantly Muslim region, which is split between
them but claimed by both.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistani President
Pervez Musharraf said they would continue to pursue peace in Kashmir after
meeting on the sidelines of a U.N. summit in New York.
</P>
<P>
"Our nations must not remain trapped by hate and history, in a cycle of
confrontation and conflict," Musharraf said Wednesday in an address to the U.N.
General Assembly. "For this to happen, it is essential to find a just solution
to the problems of Jammu-Kashmir."
</P>
<P>
It's statements like that which have Kashmiris again celebrating late into the
night _ swaying to soulful old wedding songs at parties that often have more
than 1,000 guests.
</P>
<P>
"Weddings were not as much fun a couple of years ago as they are now _ one can't
enjoy if one lives in fear," said Aijaz Banday, a 42-year-old banker. "A lot has
changed over the past few years. You couldn't imagine staying out and partying
so late in those days."
</P>
<P>
Tourists, most of them Indians, are also back in record numbers _ 600,000 so far
this year with two more months of the season left. Those are the highest numbers
since 1989, and almost twice the number of arrivals last year.
</P>
<P>
And everyone is eating chicken.
</P>
<P>
"There is a big shortage of chicken. I am getting frantic calls," said Riaz
Ahmed, owner of Shaan Poultry in Srinagar.
</P>
<P>
To meet the soaring demand, Ahmed is trying to order chickens from other parts
of India.
</P>
<P>
But the supplies must meet the approval of finicky Meraj-ud-Din, the latest in a
long line of legendary Kashmiri chefs who have for generations prepared
traditional weddings feasts of up to 40 courses, known as a "wazwan."
</P>
<P>
Wazwan platters _ each shared by four people _ include succulent pieces of lamb,
rice and vegetables and are crowned by at least one whole chicken that
Meraj-ud-din demands weigh between one kilogram (2.2 pounds) and 1.5 kilograms
(3.3 pounds). Heavier or lighter birds would look too small or too big on the
platter, he says.
</P>
<P>
Less violence means more festive wazwans.
</P>
<P>
"There are so many weddings this season, Kashmiris will be eating out all of
this month. There is great pressure," said Ahmed, the chicken
seller.
</P>
<P>
The number of attacks in Jammu-Kashmir was down by 25 percent from January to
July compared to the same period last year, dropping from more than 1,600 to
just over 1,200, officials have said. More than 66,000 people have died since
the start of the insurgency.
</P>
<P>
"This has been a far better summer than many summers before," said Police
Inspector-General Javed Makhdoomi. "The atmosphere has changed. People feel more
secure and safe."
</P>
<P>
With Kashmiris feeling safer, another wedding tradition has also been revived _
the stopping of wedding caravans on the first bridge they cross so the driver of
the bride and groom's car can be paid a customary fee for crossing the span. The
groom pays the fee.
</P>
<P>
In years past, stopping long lines of cars on the iron and wooden bridges of
Srinagar, Indian Kashmir's summer capital, would be strictly forbidden by
skittish Indian soldiers who feared the vehicles could be packed with
explosives.
</P>
<P>
These days, however, soldiers stand aside and watch the ceremonies, which
involve feverish honking, cheering and clapping on car-choked
bridges.
</P>
<P>
"These days I am reminded of my childhood, when I went to weddings holding my
father's hand," said Mohammed Zakariya, 31, a trader. "But all these years,
having fun at weddings became impossible."
</P>
<P>
In a land riven by sorrow, some small joys are returning.
