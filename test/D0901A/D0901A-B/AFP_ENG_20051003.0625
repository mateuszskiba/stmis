India, Pakistan to revive economic body after 16 years

ISLAMABAD, Oct 4

<P>
Pakistan and India were due to hold 
meetings of a long-dormant joint economic body for the first time in 
16 years Tuesday, marking a further thaw between the South Asian 
rivals, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Senior Indian diplomat Shyam Saran said the commission would 
discuss steps to promote trade ties between the nuclear-armed 
neighbours, who have fought three wars, two of them over the 
Himalayan region of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"This will be the first meeting of the joint commission after a 
gap of 16 years. This is a very significant event for our two 
countries," Saran, the senior official in the Indian foreign 
ministry, told reporters late Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Our trade and economic relations are improving," he said, 
noting that Pakistan recently used their land border to import basic 
foods including onions, garlic and potatoes from India.
</P>
<P>
The decision on the economic commission was reached Monday 
during Indian Foreign Minister Natwar Singh's talks with his 
Pakistani counterpart Khurshid Kasuri to review progress on the 
peace process between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan also signed deals under which they agreed to 
notify each other in advance on ballistic missile tests and to set 
up a hotline between their coastguards.
</P>
<P>
Both nations routinely test nuclear-capable missiles but for the 
past few years they have always given prior notice despite the lack 
of a formal agreement.
</P>
<P>
The coastguard hotline deal would lead to early exchange of 
information between the two sides on arrests of fishermen who 
inadvertently stray into rival waters, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The peace process was launched in early 2004 to resolve eight 
issues including the dispute over the Muslim-majority Himalayan 
state of Kashmir, which is divided between Indian and Pakistan and 
claimed in full by both.
</P>
<P>
In symbolic, confidence-building gestures, the two countries 
have started a cross-border bus service in Kashmir and resumed 
sporting ties, but progress has been sluggish on central problems 
such as Kashmir itself.
</P>
<P>
Saran said both sides were committed to finding a "mutually 
acceptable" solution to Kashmir but ruled out any change in 
borders.
</P>
<P>
The Islamabad foreign ministers meeting follows a summit in 
September between Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf and Indian 
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in New York that ended without any 
major initiatives.
