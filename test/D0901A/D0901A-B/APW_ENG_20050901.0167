<P>
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has invited Kashmir's separatists for peace
talks _ a move that could boost efforts to end India and Pakistan's decades-old
dispute over the Himalayan region.
</P>
<P>
Singh offered to hold talks on Sept. 5 with the moderate faction of Kashmir's
main separatist alliance, the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, the prime
minister's spokesman, Sanjaya Baru, said Wednesday
</P>
<P>
An agreement with the separatists is crucial to pushing forward the peace
process between India and Pakistan. Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority state in
predominantly Hindu India, is split between the two countries, but both claim
all of it.
</P>
<P>
The talks come ahead of a planned meeting on Sept. 14 between Singh and
Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf in New York on the sidelines of the
U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Despite improved relations in the last two years, India and Pakistan have made
few moves toward resolving the dispute over Kashmir, which lies at the core of
their rivalry and was the cause of two of three wars fought by the neighbors
since their independence from Britain in 1947.
</P>
<P>
The leader of Hurriyat, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who will head the Kashmiri
delegation, said the talks in New Delhi should help push Kashmir to the
forefront of the Indian-Pakistan peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The cycle will be complete now. India is talking to Pakistan, Pakistan talks to
us and we talk with India," he said.
</P>
<P>
Farooq was one of nine separatist leaders who traveled to Pakistan in June and
met with Musharraf to discuss Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate reaction from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Kashmir is "a complicated issue, but it can be resolved if there is sincerity
and commitment of all parties involved," he said. "If we can build trust and
confidence, the Kashmir dispute can be resolved."
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the U.S.
government welcomed discussions that would relieve tensions over
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"We encourage those discussions and they're continuing to take steps that build
up trust and confidence to address the differences they have on this issue," he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
India's previous government, led by Hindu-nationalists, held two rounds of talks
with the Kashmiris in 2004, although little progress was made before
parliamentary elections later that year brought Singh's Congress party to
power.
</P>
<P>
Since then, government officials have been in contact with Hurriyat leaders
through mediators, Baru said.
</P>
<P>
During the 2004 talks, Hurriyat leaders demanded the government release some 500
activists held as political prisoners in Indian jails, and some have since been
freed.
</P>
<P>
Farooq said he did not expect substantive discussions on Sept. 5, when the
exchanges would mostly be introductory.
</P>
<P>
Jammu-Kashmir's elected head, Chief Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed, said he
expects the meeting would pave the way for a wider dialogue that will be joined
by hard-liners, many of whom support a violent insurgency to wrest Kashmir from
India. They have so far ignored the government's call for talks.
</P>
<P>
Saifudin Soz, a Kashmiri lawmaker who is helping arrange the talks, said "an
overwhelming majority of Kashmiris _ tired of violence _ will welcome the
talks."
</P>
<P>
The Hurriyat has been demanding Kashmir's independence since the region was
split months after India and Pakistan were partitioned into independent
countries by the British.
</P>
<P>
The campaign turned violent in 1989, and there are now more than a dozen rebel
groups fighting in India's portion of Kashmir. The insurgency has killed more
than 66,000 people, most of them civilians.
</P>
<P>
Moderates, such as Hurriyat leader Farooq, have denounced the
insurgency.
