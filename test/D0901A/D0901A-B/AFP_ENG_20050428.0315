<P>
Suspected Muslim rebels killed 
three policemen, a state political party member and two others in 
the first attacks on police in Kashmir since Indian and Pakistan 
leaders met two week's ago, police said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The three policemen, one an officer, were killed in the summer 
capital Srinagar and northern Baramulla district overnight, a police 
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The officer was brought out of his house by suspected militants 
and killed by slitting his throat," he said of the officer killed in 
Baramulla.
</P>
<P>
Two other officers were shot dead -- one inside his house and 
the other while on duty near Kashmir's central jail in Srinagar.
</P>
<P>
No group claimed responsibility for the killings, the first of 
security force personnel since Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and 
President Pervez Musharraf held talks in New Delhi two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The two countries launched a peace process 15 months ago and 
after their talks in New Delhi described it as "irreversible."
</P>
<P>
The officer's slaying sparked a protest demonstration in the 
Nishat area of the city, with people demanding action against 
killers, residents said.
</P>
<P>
In other violence, suspected rebels Thursday shot dead a member 
of the state's ruling Peoples Democratic Party, Yasin Magray, at a 
busy bus stand in southern Kulgam town, 70 kilometers (43 miles) 
south of Srinagar, the spokesman said, adding a student was injured 
in the shoot-out.
</P>
<P>
Police said suspected rebels also shot dead a former colleague 
and a Muslim labourer in two separate incidents in the neighbouring 
district of Pulwama.
</P>
<P>
The rebels often target pro-India politicians and people they 
suspect of working for Indian troops.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people have died in Kashmir since the launch of 
armed insurgency in the Himalayan region in 1989.
