Kashmir bus rolls but road to peace still bumpy

NEW DELHI, April 10
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first trans-Kashmir bus in 
decades has rolled and dozens of families have been reunited across 
the divide, but real progress by nuclear-rivals India and Pakistan 
on their core dispute over Kashmir remains a long way off, analysts 
say.
</P>
<P>
"We basically see this as one of the confidence-building 
measures," said Ajai Sahni of the New Delhi-based Institute of 
Conflict Management.
</P>
<P>
"We must understand that for Pakistan, none of the fundamentals 
have really altered in terms of intent or claim."
</P>
<P>
The first bus service spanning divided Kashmir in nearly 60 
years ran simultaneously Thursday from Srinagar, the summer capital 
of Indian Kashmir and Muzaffarabad, capital of the 
Pakistan-administered zone.
</P>
<P>
Passengers crossed the heavily-militarised Kashmir frontier 
despite attempts by militants on the Indian side to derail the 
historic journey with a blast along the route and an attack a day 
earlier on a guesthouse complex in Srinagar where the passengers 
were staying.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the day, 30 people travelled the 160-kilometre 
(100-mile) route from Muzaffarabad while 19 -- down from an original 
29 -- went in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
They were greeted with sweets and garlands by thousands of 
people when they arrived on the other side, while members of divided 
families hugged each other with tears rolling down their cheeks.
</P>
<P>
"All these measures can easily be reversed the moment the 
circumstances are altered for Pakistan," Sahni said. "And President 
(Pervez) Musharraf has made this abundantly clear when he says that 
unless Kashmir is solved, there can be more Kargils."
</P>
<P>
Indian and Pakistan-backed intruders fought a short duration 
conflict in the high mountains of Kargil sector of Kashmir in 1999. 
Nearly 1,000 combatants on both sides were killed.
</P>
<P>
I.A. Rehman, director of the independent Human Rights Commission 
of Pakistan, sounded a similar cautionary note.
</P>
<P>
"It was good that despite the fire and the shooting the buses 
reached their destinations and the two governments did a splendid 
job," he told AFP in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
"(But) it does not mean that there are no hurdles left. There is 
a long way to go, but the road to peace is getting clear."
</P>
<P>
Kashmir was divided between India and Pakistan after a 1947 war 
but it is claimed in full by both countries.
</P>
<P>
Family members separated by the division of the picturesque 
Himalayan region have longed to meet each other again but have had 
to take a long roundabout route which also depended on being granted 
hard-to-get visas by New Delhi or Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Though the bus has been hailed as a powerful symbol for peace by 
the media and analysts on both sides, there is little dispute that 
the event marks only a small step on the long road to rapprochement 
for the nuclear rivals, who have fought three wars -- two over 
Kashmir -- and came close to a fourth in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Senior Pakistani defence analyst, retired brigadier Abdur Rehman 
Siddiqui, however said the bus service was here to stay.
</P>
<P>
"It may not be as historic as the fall of Berlin Wall, but 
something close to it ... It's not only symbolic but this confidence 
building measure is irreversible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tauseed Ahmed, professor of Mass Communication at Federal Urdu 
University, said: "It is good to see buses of peace and not tanks or 
guns en route to Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"It's good to see friends meeting friends, families meeting 
families without any feeling of hatred," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The forces of peace may replace the forces of hatred if more 
people started travelling, he said, but warned that hostile elements 
may again try to sabotage the process.
</P>
<P>
"Give peace a chance and the Kashmir issue can be resolved," 
Ahmed said.
</P>
<P>
Indian analyst Sahni believes the bus has indeed taken forward 
the slow-moving peace process between India and Pakistan which began 
in January last year and has improved the atmosphere before 
Musharraf's scheduled visit to New Delhi next weekend.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf is due to watch a one-day cricket match between India 
and Pakistan on April 17. He will also hold talks with Indian Prime 
Minister Manmohan Singh -- their first formal talks since Singh 
became premier last May.
