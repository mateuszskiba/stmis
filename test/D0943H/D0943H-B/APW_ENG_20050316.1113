Ripudaman Singh Malik was found not guilty Wednesday in the deaths of 329 people
who perished when Air India Flight 182 was brought down by a bomb 20 years ago
in Canada's worst case of mass murder.

Justice Ian Josephson was still to pass judgment on Ajaib Singh Bagri, 55, who
along with Malik had faced charges of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit
murder and attempted murder in the downing of Flight 182.

About 100 people began lining up outside the B.C. Supreme Court building under
tight security and in a steady rain trying to get seats to hear Justice Ian
