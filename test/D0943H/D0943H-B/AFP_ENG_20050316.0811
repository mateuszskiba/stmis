Two Sikh men walked free 
after a judge Wednesday acquitted them of massacring 329 people in a 
1985 Air India jet bombing, in the worst single airborne terror 
strike before September 11, 2001.
</P>
<P>
Loved ones of victims gasped in shock, as the judge threw out 
eight counts of murder and conspiracy each against Ajaib Singh 
Bagri, 55, and Ripudaman Singh Malik, 58.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic judgements followed a near two-year trial on 
prosecution claims that the two men planted the bomb, and another 
device which exploded on the ground in Tokyo, to punish India for 
its crackdown on Sikhs in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the horrific nature of the alleged crimes, there can be 
no lowering of the standard of proof from that required in any 
criminal trial," said Justice Ian Bruce Josephson in the British 
Columbia Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The evidence had fallen "markedly short" of the standard 
required to convict the men, said Josephson, who heard the case in a 
specially constructed blast-resistant courtroom without a jury.
</P>
<P>
Shellshocked prosecutors were left to ponder whether there was 
ground for appeal, and to defend their decision to bring the case to 
court.
</P>
<P>
"It is premature to say at this stage what will transpire," said 
prosecution spokesman Geoffrey Gaul.
</P>
<P>
But Josephson's verdict was so withering, and questioning of key 
witness testimony so acute, that the feasibility of an appeal was in 
question.
</P>
<P>
Malik and Bagri, orthodox Sikhs who immigrated to Canada from 
Punjab, were accused of conspiring to plant suitcase bombs on two 
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors claimed the two men worked with a Sikh group to 
build suitcase bombs on Vancouver Island, then planted the 
explosives on two flights from Vancouver that connected with Air 
India planes.
</P>
<P>
One bomb exploded in the hold of Air India Flight 182 over the 
Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Ireland on June 23, 1985. All 329 
people aboard the jumbo jet died.
</P>
<P>
Just 54 minutes earlier, another bomb had exploded at Japan's 
Narita airport, killing two baggage handlers transferring suitcases 
to Air India Flight 201.
</P>
<P>
Bagri, a free man for the first time in four years, told 
reporters outside court that he had been accused of horrendous 
crimes.
</P>
<P>
"I had absolutely no involvement in any of these criminal acts. 
The loss of so many innocent lives resulting from these events was 
an enormous tragedy."
</P>
<P>
But for relatives of those who perished on the Air India plane, 
there was only the agony of reopened wounds, 20 years on, and 
demands for the true culprits of the outrage to be brought to 
justice.
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it, I can't believe it," one man cried in 
court.
</P>
<P>
Another man, Rattan Singh Kalsi, who lost his daughter in the 
tragedy on June 23, 1985, was crying along with his wife.
</P>
<P>
"They should not have brought the case to court. We were 
suffering but now we are suffering more."
</P>
<P>
Rumi Shross, who lost a friend in the disaster, said he could 
not comprehend the verdict.
</P>
<P>
"I have no words to describe it, how difficult it is," he told 
CBC television.
</P>
<P>
"I lost a very dear friend 20 years ago, my mind is totally 
blank ... 329 innocent lives were lost."
</P>
<P>
Canada's Deputy Prime Minister Anne McLellan said it was too 
early to say whether a public inquiry was needed, despite calls from 
victims' families who argue the police and security services botched 
the case.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the acquitted Bagri and Malik, a third man, Inderjit 
Singh Reyat was convicted in the Narita explosion and sentenced to 
10 years, before he was charged with the bomb on Flight 182. 
</P>
<P>
In 2003, just before the trial was to begin, Reyat pleaded 
guilty to manslaughter, and is serving a five-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
Another immigrant to Canada, Tarwinder Singh Parma, was the 
alleged mastermind of the plot and died in a 1992 police shootout in 
India.
</P>
<P>
During the trial, prosecutors contended that Malik, a 
millionaire Vancouver businessman, and Bagri, a rural millworker, 
were part of a radical Sikh group based on Canada's west coast.
</P>
<P>
Its mission was to punish India for its crackdown on Sikhs in 
the early 1980s and the army's attack on the Sikh Golden Temple at 
Amritsar, prosecutor Robert Wright told the court.
