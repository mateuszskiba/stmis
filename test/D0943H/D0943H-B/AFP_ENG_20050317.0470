<P>
Venomous demands for justice 
besieged Canada's government Thursday, after two Sikhs were cleared 
of killing 329 people in a 1985 Air India jet bombing.
</P>
<P>
Loved ones of victims, the press and foes of Prime Minister Paul 
Martin's government demanded to know why there were no murder 
convictions after a 20 year probe which cost 100 million dollars (82 
million) 
</P>
<P>
Families of passengers who perished, in both Canada and India, 
proclaimed a "mockery of justice" and demanded a government 
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Canada's newspapers Thursday reflected a wave of shock at the 
acquittals of two Sikh men Ajaib Singh Bagri and Ripadaman Singh at 
the British Columbia Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Toronto-based Globe and Mail devoted its front page to the 
headline "innocent" and the names of the 329 victims, 135 of them 
children, plus two baggage handlers killed in Tokyo in a related 
attack.
</P>
<P>
There were few critics of the judge, who found that the 
prosecution in the case, in Vancouver, the origin of two suitcase 
bombs, had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the two men 
were guilty.
</P>
<P>
"But Canadians can and should know what happened, how the 
investigation was handled, why it took so long to make arrests and 
whether Canada's police and intelligence communities have learned 
from it," the Toronto Star said in a hard-hitting editorial.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Anne McLellan, said in the immediate 
aftermath of the verdict that she could "not see any benefit" to 
calling a public inquiry.
</P>
<P>
But relatives who lost loved ones on Wednesday lined up in a 
press conference in Vancouver to blast the Canadian police system 
and secret services and the government.
</P>
<P>
"The perpetrators of this crime are free men today, they have 
made a mockery of the Canadian justice system, said Eddie Maddon, 
whose father Sam died in the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
"The Canadian justice system has made a mockery of all of us," 
said John Chatlani, whose mother, brother and sister died.
</P>
<P>
Lata Pada, whose husband and two daughters died aboard the jumbo 
said the verdict "flies in the face of what we believe Canada to be, 
a fair society  ... the government needs to be held accountable for 
this betrayal."
</P>
<P>
Relatives in victims in India also turned their fire on Canada.
</P>
<P>
"If the two accused who were narrowed down after a lot of 
investigation are not the culprits, then who is it," asked Bollywood 
actor Vijayendra Ghatge whose sister Sangeeta died in the mid-air 
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
"Initially after the verdict I was disappointed, but now we 
relatives of the victims feel that justice needs to be done and 
there should be further, deep investigation," Ghatge told AFP.
