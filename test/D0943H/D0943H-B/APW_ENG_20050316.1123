After a two-year trial, a Canadian judge on Wednesday acquitted two Indian-born
Sikhs of murder and other charges in the deaths of 331 people killed in the
bombings of an Air India plane over the Atlantic and at Tokyo's airport 20 years
ago.

<P>
British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Ian Josephson said the prosecution's
witnesses were not credible.
</P>
<P>
Josephson found Ripudaman Singh Malik, 58, and Ajaib Singh Bagri, 55, not guilty
on all eight charges each man faced, including first-degree murder and
conspiracy to commit murder.

On June 23, 1985, Air India Flight 182 from Montreal to London, carrying luggage
and passengers originating in Vancouver, exploded and crashed into the Atlantic
Ocean off the coast of Ireland. All 329 people on board, mostly Canadians, were
killed.
</P>
<P>
An hour earlier, a bomb in baggage intended for another Air India flight
exploded in the Tokyo airport, killing two baggage handlers.
</P>
<P>
Canadian prosecutors claimed that the two explosions were the result of one
conspiracy, an act of revenge by Sikh separatists for the 1984 raid by Indian
forces on the Golden Temple at Amritsar, the holiest site in their
religion.
