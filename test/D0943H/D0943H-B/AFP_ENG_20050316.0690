   A Canadian judge on 
Wednesday acquitted two Sikh men accused of murdering 329 people in 
an Air India jet bombing off the coast of Ireland in 1985.
   In a stunning verdict which reduced some relatives of victims in 
the court to tears, Justice Ian Bruce Josephson threw out eight 
counts of murder and conspiracy against Ajaib Singh Bagri and 
Ripudaman Singh Malik.
   The judgements came after a 20-year investigation, and a 
19-month trial into the world's worst airborne terror strike prior 
to the attacks of September 11, 2001.
