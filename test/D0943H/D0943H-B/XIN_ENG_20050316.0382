A Canadian judge announced 
Wednesday that Sikh businessman Ripudaman Singh Malik and sawmill 
worker Ajaib Singh Bagri were not guilty of conspiracy and murder 
in the 1985 Air India bombing that killed 329 people.
</P>
<P>
Justice Ian Bruce Josephson of the British Columbia Supreme 
Court said he simply did not believe the testimony of witnesses 
who linked the men to the bombing. Calling them inconsistent, he 
said the accounts surfaced too late to be credible.
</P>
<P>
He did, however, accept the Crown Court's theory that there was
a conspiracy to bring down two Air India flights by planting bombs
in suitcases that were placed on planes leaving the Vancouver 
airport.
</P>
<P>
Bagri and Malik, who had been on trial since April 28, 2003, 
were charged with first-degree murder over the death of 329 people
as well as a variety of other charges connected with the bomb that
blew up Air India Flight 182 on June 23, 1985.
</P>
<P>
The flight exploded and crashed off Ireland's Atlantic coast, 
on its way from Canada to India, via London. All 329 people on 
board, mostly Canadians, were killed.
</P>
<P>
The two men were also accused of causing a separate bombing at 
Tokyo's Narita airport. Two baggage handlers died just 54 minutes 
before Flight 182 exploded when a bomb went off inside a suitcase 
they were transferring to another Air India plane, Flight 301.
</P>
<P>
Canada's prosecutors alleged the bombings were an act of 
vengeance against the government of India following a 1984 raid on
the Golden Temple at Amritsar, the holiest shrine for Sikhs.
