<P>
Canadian prosecutors began wrapping up their final arguements here
Monday in the trial of two Sikh immigrants from India charged with
conspiring to bomb Air India passenger jets in 1985, resulting in the
deaths of 331 people.
</P>
<P>
The two Sikh immigrants, Ajaib Singh Bagri and Ripudaman Singh Malik,
are each charged with eight counts of murder and conspiracy in the
bombing, the deadliest single terrorist act until the September 11,
2001 attacks in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have argued that Bagri and Malik were among a group of
orthodox Sikh immigrants to Canada who, in the turbulent 1980s, waged
a campaign against India for its crackdown on religious Sikhs.
</P>
<P>
Bagri's lawyer says his client was the innocent victim in the case.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Robin Wright said his team will drive home an arguement
that the pair were part of a plot to check two suitcase bombs onto
Air India aircraft departing Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
He said proof of their guilt ranges from providing financial
assistance to a man convicted in the case, attempting to interfere
with police investigations and admissions to people they trusted.
</P>
<P>
Two bombs blew up on June 23, 1985, with the first killing two
baggage handlers at Japan's Narita airport as they transferred
baggage to an Air India plane. The second bomb killed 329 passengers
aboard Air India Flight 182 off the Irish Coast.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt these people were murdered," said Wright, adding
that the only explanation for the bombing was "political and
religious zealotry."
</P>
<P>
The case against Bagri and Malik relies on key witnesses who say the
accused confessed details of their involvement, circumstantial
evidence, and motives.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say both men were part of a group of extremist Sikhs bent
on avenging India's attack on the Sikh Golden Temple at Amritsar in
1984.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution team will spend the next three weeks finalizing their
case before Justice Ian Bruce Josephson.
</P>
<P>
Josephson is hearing the complicated trial alone without a jury.
Earlier this month, defence teams for both accused wrapped up their
closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
The judge is expected to reserve his ruling in the case, possibly for
several months.
