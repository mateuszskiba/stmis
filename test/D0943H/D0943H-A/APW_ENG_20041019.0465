Defense arguments herald beginning of end to lengthy Air India
terrorist bombing case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The trial of two men accused of bombing an Air India jumbo jet and
killing 329 people almost 20 years ago entered its final stretch
Tuesday with the defense attacking the credibility of a star
government witness.
</P>
<P>
Vancouver millionaire Ripudaman Singh Malik, 57, and Kamloops,
British Columbia mill worker Ajaib Singh Bagri, 55, are charged with
multiple counts of conspiracy and first degree murder in the world's
worst airline terrorism act prior to the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Air India flight 182, a Boeing 747 on its way from Toronto to India
via London, blew up off the Irish coast on June 23, 1985, killing all
aboard.
</P>
<P>
Malik and Bagri, who have been in custody since their arrest in late
2000, are also charged in connection with a blast on the same day
that killed two baggage handlers at Tokyo's Narita Airport.
</P>
<P>
The case in British Columbia Supreme Court has stretched for 13
months since hearings began in April 2003. More than 32 lawyers are
working on the case, which is believed to have cost more than US$80
million (euro64 million).
</P>
<P>
Perviz Madon lost her husband, Sam, on flight 182. She wants to see
the trial over by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
"It's time we had a closure," she said. "It's been 20 years, for
God's sake. We're tired."
</P>
<P>
Final arguments are expected to last into December. The case is being
heard in a US$5 million (euro4 million) courtroom specifically built
for security precautions.
</P>
<P>
The defense argument hinges on attacking the credibility of a star
witness for the government, and asserting that at least one of the
defendants lacked a motive.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer David Crossin argued Tuesday that the witness had an
ulterior motive to testify against Malik because she is a former
disgruntled employee of his. The woman is in a government witness
protection program and a court order bars the publication of her
name.
</P>
<P>
The woman, who testified that she had a close personal relationship
with Malik, wrote in her diary that he had said: "We had Air India
crash. Nobody, nobody can do anything."
</P>
<P>
Crossin said the prosecution's case "stands or falls on the evidence
of this woman."
</P>
<P>
"We suggest the nature of that false evidence is profound," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another prosecution witness, a man who was a member of a Sikh
militant group in New York, testified that Bagri as much as confessed
to him outside a New Jersey gas station.
</P>
<P>
"We did this," the man, whom the Canadian government paid US$365,000
(euro293,000) to testify, said Bagri told him. His identity is also
protected by the court.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors believe Malik and Bagri were part of a conspiracy by
British Columbia-based Sikh extremists to take revenge against the
Indian government, which owns Air India planes, for attacking a Sikh
temple in 1984.
</P>
<P>
But the defense argued Tuesday there is no evidence Malik was at all
interested in Indian politics. Defense lawyers also contended that he
had substantial dealings with the state bank of India, which militant
Sikhs would have boycotted.
</P>
<P>
"In our view, it is inconceivable that anyone would have participated
in this crime without a political motive," Crossin said.
</P>
<P>
Bagri's political motivation appears more concrete. A month after the
temple raid, thousands of Sikhs gathered at Madison Square Garden in
New York City where Bagri reportedly told The World Sikh
Organization: "Until we kill 50,000 Hindus we will not rest."
</P>
<P>
He proposed the creation of a Sikh homeland called Khalistan and
"spoke of the need for Sikhs to wage a war of independence to exact
revenge against the Indian government," according to documents
released by the court.
</P>
<P>
Bagri has also been accused of inciting people at Sikh temples in
British Columbia and Ontario, and for calling for the death of then
Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi. She was assassinated in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Much of the case, however, hinges on the position of the bomb on
Flight 182, which originated in Vancouver. Prosecutors have argued
the bomb was in luggage originating in Vancouver. But Bagri's lawyers
contend the luggage containing the bomb joined the flight in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
If Judge Ian Josephson accepts that defense, Bagri may be acquitted.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors maintain that Talwinder Singh Parmar, founder of the
militant Babbar Khalsa Sikh militant group, was the mastermind behind
the bombings. He died in a shootout with Indian police in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Mysterious deaths have dogged the case from the start. Tara Singh
Hayer, a Vancouver-area Sikh newspaper publisher and outspoken critic
of Sikh extremism, was crippled after being shot in 1988. He was
killed in November 1998 after another shooting.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Bagri also allegedly confessed his involvement to Tarsem
Singh Purewal, publisher of Britain's biggest Punjabi weekly
newspaper. Purewal, who was murdered in 1995, had been friends with
Hayer.
