Air India bombing trial wraps up; verdict due next spring
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Final arguments in the murder trial of two Sikhs charged with the
1985 bombing of an Air India jumbo jet concluded, ending one of the
most exhaustive and expensive trials in Canadian history.
</P>
<P>
The trial against a millionaire and a mill worker charged with
multiple counts of conspiracy and first-degree murder hinges on the
testimony of three star witnesses and contradicting bombing experts.
</P>
<P>
British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Ian Josephson announced Friday
he will deliver a decision on March 16, 2005.
</P>
<P>
The case has called 115 witnesses since it began in April 2003. With
a specially built courtroom, the trial cost more than US$100 million
(euro75 million).
</P>
<P>
Ripudaman Singh Malik, a 57-year-old millionaire, and Ajaib Singh
Bagri, 55, are charged with planting bombs that exploded June 23,
1985, aboard Flight 182, killing 329 people, and 53 minutes earlier
at Tokyo's Narita Airport, killing two baggage handlers.
</P>
<P>
Alleged bombmaker Inderjit Singh Reyat has already pleaded guilty to
manslaughter and is in prison.
</P>
<P>
Perviz Madon lost her husband, Sam, on Flight 182. She and her son,
Eddie, have attended the trial regularly.
</P>
<P>
"I think the waiting is going to be hard," she said of the case going
to the judge. "Let's just hope the wait will be worth it."
</P>
<P>
The prosecution alleges the motive was revenge against the Indian
government's 1984 attack against separatists who had taken refuge in
the Golden Temple of Amritsar, Sikhism's holiest shrine.
</P>
<P>
The attack also led to the 1984 assassination of Indian Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said the accused were zealots driven by a desire to
create an independent Sikh state of Khalistan in the Punjab region of
northern India and wanted to teach the Indian government a lesson.
</P>
<P>
"All Sikhs ... felt a terrible sacrilege had been committed against
their religion," prosecutor Joe Bellows said during closing
arguments.
</P>
<P>
While the defense maintains there is no evidence Malik was interested
in Indian politics, Bagri's political motivation appeared more
concrete.
</P>
<P>
A month after the temple raid, thousands of Sikhs gathered at Madison
Square Garden in New York City where Bagri reportedly told The World
Sikh Organization: "Until we kill 50,000 Hindus we will not rest."
</P>
<P>
The prosecution has alleged Malik and Bagri were members of the
Babbar Khalsa Sikh terrorist group led by Talwinder Singh Parmar, the
alleged mastermind of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Parmar died in a shootout with Indian police in 1992.
</P>
<P>
A prosecution witness who testified that she had a close personal
relationship with Malik, wrote in her diary that he had said: "We had
Air India crash. Nobody, nobody can do anything."
</P>
<P>
The defense has tried to discredit the testimony, saying she was a
disgruntled former employee motivated by revenge.
</P>
<P>
The judge must also decide between the conflicting testimony of two
bombing experts who testified earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Bagri's lawyer, Richard Peck, said Friday: "This case has been a trek
across a vast expanse of knowledge, experience, and law."
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyer for Malik, David Crossin, called the case a
"logistical nightmare" and said, "I don't think there will ever be
such a case like this again, in this country, or perhaps the world."
</P>
<P>
"It was a long haul, I'm glad it's over," Crossin said.
</P>
<P>
Crown spokesman Geoffrey Gaul said the trial lasted 202 days total
and included 113 witnesses. In all, 178 family members attended, many
coming from around the world to view the trial, said Gaul.
</P>
<P>
Mysterious deaths have dogged the case from the start. Tara Singh
Hayer, a Vancouver-area Sikh newspaper publisher and outspoken critic
of Sikh extremism, was crippled after being shot in 1988. He was
killed later that year in another shooting.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Bagri allegedly confessed his involvement to Tarsem Singh
Purewal, a publisher of Britain's biggest Punjabi weekly newspaper
who was murdered later that year.
