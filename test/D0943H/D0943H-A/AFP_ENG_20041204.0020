Two men charged with murder and conspiracy in the Air India bombings,
the world's most lethal terror strike prior to September 11, 2001,
will wait until March to hear a verdict, a judge said Friday.
</P>
<P>
After 19 months of complex hearings, the massive trial of Ajaib Singh
Bagri and Ripudaman Singh Malik ended Friday with lawyers on all
sides trying to score a few last points.
</P>
<P>
Justice Ian Bruce Josephson, who heard the case without a jury in
this western Canadian city, said he will reveal his decision March
16.
</P>
<P>
Bagri and Malik, who were arrested in 2000, are each charged with
eight counts related to two bombings on June 23, 1985.
</P>
<P>
On that day a suitcase bomb exploded at Japan's Narita airport,
killing two Japanese baggage handlers as they transferred it to an
Air India jet.
</P>
<P>
Less than an hour later, Air India Flight 182 exploded off the Irish
coast, killing all 329 aboard.
</P>
<P>
John Ward of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police told reporters that
250 officers have worked on the case since 1985. The investigation
into more suspects continues, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We still have 12 RCMP officers working on this case. We're not done
yet."
</P>
<P>
Prosecution spokesperson Geoffrey Gaul said 113 witnesses testified
for the government and for Bagri and Malik's defence teams.
</P>
<P>
The trial was held behind bullet-resistant glass in a
specially-built, secure, 7.5-million-dollar (6.3 million US)
underground courtroom.
</P>
<P>
Bagri, a Sikh preacher and rural millworker, and Malik, a millionaire
Vancouver businessman, maintained their innocence.
</P>
<P>
The pair is accused of taking part in a plot by Sikh fundamentalists
to build two bombs and plant them on two flights leaving Vancouver
that connected with Air India flights to London and Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Government prosecutors contend that Malik arranged and paid for the
airline tickets used to check the suitcase bombs onto planes, and
that Bagri arranged to get the bombs to the airport.
</P>
<P>
The motive in targetting the Indian planes, said Gaul, was to fight
for the cause of an independent Sikh homeland, to be called
Khalistan, and avenge India's 1984 attack on the Sikh Golden Temple
at Amritsar.
</P>
<P>
The alleged mastermind of the plot, Talwinder Singh Parmar, was
killed in a police shootout in India in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20 years will have elapsed by the time Josephson rules on the
guilt of the two men, who emigrated to Canada from Punjab.
</P>
<P>
A third man in Canada, Inderjit Singh Reyat, pled guilty in 2003 to
manslaughter for his role in providing material for the bomb on
Flight 182, and was sentenced to five years.
</P>
<P>
The Air India bombing stood as the worst terror attack in modern
history, until it was overtaken by the carnage of the attacks on the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the United States in 2001.
