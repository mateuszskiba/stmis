Supreme Court Justices Debate Death Penalty for Minors

<P>
The Supreme Court struggled Wednesday over whether
the time has come to end the death penalty for young murderers. Now
that Iran and Congo say they have repudiated the practice, the United
States stands alone in the world in sanctioning the execution of
minors.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the court in a 6-3 decision abolished capital
punishment for the mentally retarded, saying that a ``national
consensus'' had emerged that executing such persons amounted to cruel
and unusual punishment. They noted that all but a handful of states
had exempted mentally retarded persons from the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the justices debated whether a similar national
consensus exists that now calls for limiting capital punishment to
murderers who are age 18 or above when they commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
Despite the vote of two years ago, it was not clear from
Wednesday's argument that a majority would exempt youthful killers.
</P>
<P>
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said he was worried that teenage
criminals will be emboldened if they are free from the full force of
the criminal law. ``Juveniles run in gangs,'' he said, reasoning that
gang members would dodge the death penalty by recruiting their
youngest members as ``the hit man.''
</P>
<P>
``I'm very concerned about that,'' said Kennedy, who voted in the
majority to stop the death penalty for mentally retarded individuals.
</P>
<P>
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the other swing vote, noted that
several states in recent years have raised the minimum age to 18 for
imposing the death penalty. ``It's about the same consensus that
existed on mental retardation,'' she said, in a hopeful sign for the
foes of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
Currently, most states either have no death penalty law or set 18
as the minimum age. Still, 19 states permit prosecutors to seek a
death sentence for murderers who are 16 or 17, although fewer have
done so of late. In 1999, for example, 14 underage murderers received
death sentences, but the number has declined steadily. Only two
teenage murderers received death sentences last year and only one such
sentence has been handed down this year.
</P>
<P>
The clear leader remains Texas. As of June 30, 72 people who were
16 or 17 at the time of their crimes sat on death rows around the
nation, and 28 of them were in Texas.
</P>
<P>
The case before the court Wednesday came from Missouri. It
concerned Christopher Simmons, who in 1993 abducted a woman in his
neighborhood, bound her in duct tape and threw her alive into a river
from a railroad bridge. He was 17 at the time of the murder and
bragged to a friend that he would get off because of his age.
</P>
<P>
Instead, a jury outside St. Louis convicted him and sentenced him
to die. The Missouri Supreme Court voided the death sentence and
ordered him to spend life in prison, and the state attorney general
filed an appeal.
</P>
<P>
James Layton, a Missouri state attorney, urged the justices to let
juries weigh each case and decide for themselves when a murderer
deserves death.
</P>
<P>
If the age for capital punishment needs to be changed, it should be
done by elected lawmakers, not judges, he said. ``Age is a legislative
question. It is the kind of fact a legislature should decide, not this
court,'' he argued.
</P>
<P>
Seth Waxman, the former U.S. solicitor general in the Clinton
administration, argued for Simmons and he urged the high court to set
a constitutional rule that limits capital punishment to those who are
legally adults.
</P>
<P>
In law, ``18 is the bright line between childhood and adulthood,''
he said. Since young people need to be age 18 to vote, to join the
military, to gamble, or even to marry without their parents' consent,
it is reasonable to set 18 as the minimum age for capital punishment,
he said.
</P>
<P>
``We are literally alone in the world'' in permitting the
executions of those who committed crimes as juveniles, Waxman said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Commission on Human Rights said six nations
besides the United States executed juvenile offenders during the
1990s. They are Congo, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and
Yemen. But its report said all of these countries have repudiated the
practice in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
A long list of other groups, including the American Medical
Association, the American Psychological Association, the U.S.
Conference of Catholic Bishops, the European Union and Nobel Prize
laureates led by former President Carter, filed briefs urging the
court to halt the execution of young offenders.
</P>
<P>
Four justices -- John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer -- have said in the past they believe
such executions are a ``shameful practice'' and should be abolished.
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and
Clarence Thomas have said the court should leave the issue to the
states.
</P>
<P>
The justices will meet behind closed doors later this week to vote
on the case of Roper vs. Simmons. A ruling is due in several months.
