Missouri slaying center of debate over juvenile death penalty
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Eleven years later, the chilling imagery of her sister's murder still
makes Pertie Mitchell shiver.
</P>
<P>
During a burglary, two teens stretched duct tape across Shirley
Crook's mouth and eyes, then muscled her into her van. An hour later,
the hogtied woman was dumped off into the murky Meramec River.
</P>
<P>
"Bubble, bubble," witnesses later said they heard Christopher Simmons
snicker as the woman's body sank.
</P>
<P>
"It makes your hands sweat, your stomach sick," Mitchell said, hoping
for the day that Simmons is put to death. "I will be there. I will
watch him die."
</P>
<P>
The execution is not certain, though. Using the Simmons case, the
U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday on whether it is
constitutional to execute killers who were juveniles when the crimes
were committed.
</P>
<P>
The court agreed to hear the case after the Missouri Supreme Court
last year struck down executions of juveniles and re-sentenced
Simmons, now 28, to life in prison, deciding that such executions
violate "evolving standards of decency."
</P>
<P>
Nineteen states allow executions of killers who were 16 or 17 at the
time of the crime. Since the 1976 reinstatement of the death penalty,
22 people _ 13 of them in Texas _ have been executed for crimes
committed as 16- or 17-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court in 1988 barred the death penalty for those 15
and younger.
</P>
<P>
Simmons and his attorneys did not reply to interview requests. His
advocates have said that executing people who kill as juveniles would
be just as wrong as putting to death the mentally challenged, a
practice outlawed by the Supreme Court in 2002.
</P>
<P>
People less than 18 years old, they argue, don't have fully developed
brains and are incapable of making rational decisions.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell believes Simmons, who was then 17, was old enough to know
right from wrong.
</P>
<P>
"You know how many people get married or join the service when
they're 17 or 18 years old?" said Mitchell, 66. "This man has nothing
to justify what he did."
</P>
<P>
Simmons' advocates argue that he led a tough life, from the time his
parents separated. Abuse by a relative, they said, included tying him
as a toddler to a tree for hours to keep him from wandering while the
man fished _ or taking him to a bar and plying him with alcohol for
the amusement of patrons.
</P>
<P>
By 13, Simmons was smoking marijuana and swilling hard liquor. He
dabbled with mushrooms, cocaine and LSD, and broke into cars and
homes.
</P>
<P>
About 2 a.m. on Sept. 9, 1993, Simmons and Charles Benjamin, then 15,
found an open window at the home of Crook, a neighbor near St. Louis.
Crook was sleeping alone inside; her husband Steven _ like her, a
trucker _ was away on the road.
</P>
<P>
Simmons bound her and forced her _ wearing only underwear and cowboy
boots _ into her van. They drove 26 kilometers (16 miles) to
Castlewood State Park, led her to the middle of the trestle above the
Meramec and tossed her into the water.
</P>
<P>
Two fishermen found the body 12 hours later.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Simmons privately boasted of killing Crook because
she had seen his face. He was arrested the next day.
</P>
<P>
"I have a picture in my mind that she can't see, she can't speak, she
can't scream out," Crook's daughter, Kimberly Hawkins, said at
Simmons' trial. "I can imagine the terror that she's thinking."
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors called the crimes anything but impulsive. They said
Simmons believed he could escape punishment because he was a
juvenile.
</P>
<P>
Simmons later claimed that any scheming was "just stupid talk," and
he denied ever believing he could get away with it because he was a
minor. He was sentenced to death in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin, tried separately as an adult but not eligible for the death
sentence, given his age, was convicted and sentenced to life without
parole.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Benjamin, now 26,
said he hopes Simmons prevails, thinking adolescence mitigates
culpability.
</P>
<P>
"I believe age should factor in some way _ not the death penalty,"
Benjamin said from prison. Crook's death, he said, is "not something
that can be easily blocked out."
</P>
<P>
These days, Mitchell talks of little successes, like paring to just
one the number of antidepressants she still takes to deal with the
crime that "never leaves you."
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine what Shirley must have been feeling, fighting for a
breath of air and what her mind must have been saying to her? I think
of that all the time," she said.
</P>
<P>
"You'd think I'd cried enough, but it never ends."
