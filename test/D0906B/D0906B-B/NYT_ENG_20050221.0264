<P>
A winter storm pummeled Southern California on Monday
for the third straight day, claiming the lives of three
people and raising fears of mudslides -- even as homes
around the region were evacuated.
</P>
<P>
The downpour is expected to drop up to 3 more inches
by Wednesday, making this the wettest year on record in
Los Angeles through the end of February.
</P>
<P>
Mudslides killed a 63-year-old man in Woodland Hills and a teenager
in Orange County, and forced the evacuation of homes in
Glendale, Pasadena, Bel-Air and coastal La Conchita. A 47-year-old Los
Angeles civil engineer died late Sunday when he fell into
a house-size sinkhole in Sun Valley.
</P>
<P>
Across the Southland, freeways jammed. Commuter train service stalled. Wind and
lightning knocked out power to thousands. Nickel-size hail fell on
downtown Los Angeles. And farmers, weary of near-record rains, worried
about millions in potential crop damage.
</P>
<P>
Residents, meanwhile, struggled to repair leaky roofs as retailers reported a
run on rain gear, umbrellas and windshield wipers.
</P>
<P>
"Enough already with the rain. It's been really, really bad driving,"
said Denise Elder, 58, a nurse who lives off Mulholland
Drive in Woodland Hills. "I feel every time I go
up Topanga, the hill's going to fold in on me."
</P>
<P>
Early Monday, rescue workers recovered the body of civil engineer Rory
Shaw, who drowned after tumbling into the massive Sun Valley
sinkhole -- 150 feet wide by 30 feet deep, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Mayor James Hahn, who had visited the site just hours earlier,
ordered flags lowered to half-staff in honor of the Department
of Public Works employee.
</P>
<P>
Robert Wickham, 63, was killed about 2:30 a.m. when a 4-foot
wall of mud ripped through his home in the 4100
block of Natoma Avenue in Woodland Hills, officials said. In
Orange County, 16-year-old Caitlin Oto died when huge boulders crashed
through her family's home east of Irvine.
</P>
<P>
And in Silver Lake, three people were briefly trapped inside a
one-story house that slid 30 feet down a hill, and
three nearby homes were evacuated as a precaution. The home
at 1459 Angelus Ave. slid down the slope just before
6 p.m. The occupants escaped without serious injury.
</P>
<P>
Rainfall by Monday was more than 32 inches in downtown, more
than three times the average to date of 9.89 inches
and on the way to beating the annual record of
38.18 inches set in 1883-84.
</P>
<P>
By 6 p.m. Monday, Burbank had received 0.57 of an inch,
Thousand Oaks 2.4 inches, Lancaster 0.77 of an inch and
downtown Los Angeles 2.79 inches.
</P>
<P>
The mountains got 4 feet to 8 feet of snow above
5,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
Forecasters predicted a 70 percent chance of rain today, with a
40 percent chance of showers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
To coordinate its storm response, Los Angeles opened its Emergency Operations
Center, with Hahn reporting that the city will likely be
forced to dip into its reserves to pay for storm-related
overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
"This is a powerful storm," Hahn said during a watery press
conference. "We're asking people if they don't need to be
on the road, stay home."
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power reported 3,500 to
4,000 scattered power outages in Woodland Hills, Van Nuys and
Venice Beach.
</P>
<P>
Southern California Edison Co. reported 3,200 outages, mostly in Palos Verdes.
Since Friday's storm, 230,000 customers have gone without power.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we make some headway we lose ground," said
Edison spokesman Steve Conroy.
</P>
<P>
By Monday afternoon, firefighters had responded to 1,000 storm-related calls --
three times the normal service complaints.
</P>
<P>
Residents with leaky roofs and chimneys flocked to such stores as
Home Depot for tarps, roofing cement and rain gear.
</P>
<P>
"The calls are nonstop," said Greg Killick of At Home Services
at the Home Depot in Woodland Hills, while telling one
man how to cover a leaky chimney. "We've run out
of rain gear."
</P>
<P>
Woodland Hills resident Peter Lauer, new tarp in hand, woke up
to the sound of rainwater dripping on his Taylor guitar,
the fault of a leaky chimney. Many didn't sleep on
account of the rain -- and concerns about leaks or
floods.
</P>
<P>
"I was up in the attic with a flashlight last night,
I was so scared," said Cheryl Plantz, 50, of Woodland
Hills, whose sump pump has worked overtime to suck water
from her hillside-home basement.
</P>
<P>
In the coastal Ventura County community of La Conchita, six of
39 remaining residents who had survived last month's mudslide elected
to leave during the night.
</P>
<P>
In Glendale, 30 residents in eight homes were evacuated because of
mudslides and floods.
</P>
<P>
"I just heard a deafening roar and thought it was thunder,"
said Leo Saragueta, a retiree from Glendale who was forced
to leave his home. "But then we heard trees cracking
and snapping, and the scariest part is we couldn't see."
</P>
<P>
In all, seven homes in Los Angeles were red-tagged -- preventing
residents from entry -- and 25 more are yellow-tagged for
limited access because of the storm.
</P>
<P>
Baghdassar Sukiassians awoke in the middle of the night to the
sound of a massive eucalyptus tree crashing through his roof.
</P>
<P>
"We thought first it was an explosion," said the Woodland Hills
resident, who awoke to branches poking through his ceiling.
</P>
<P>
Mud also played havoc on the roadways, where a slide caused
a SigAlert on the 405 Freeway at Interstate 5 early
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Caltrans, Palmdale Boulevard (Highway 138) will remain closed from
the Golden State Freeway to the Antelope Valley Freeway until
crews can clean up mud and debris spilling across the
road.
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, Highway 126 was closed between Fillmore and Piru
and Highway 33 is washed out from Wheeler Campground to
Lockwood Valley Road.
</P>
<P>
Metrolink canceled some commuter train service north of Moorpark and Amtrak
curtailed northbound service between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. Because
of mudslides, the MTA Gold Line was forced onto a
single track between Highland Park and Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Ventura County, already socked with nearly $52 million in
storm-related damages, cautiously eyed their rain-covered fields. Strawberry-field workers struggled
through mud to stop rot and mold, while other farmers
struggled to clear their crops.
</P>
<P>
"It's making it really hard to get the vegetables out of
the ground," said Scott Deardorff, co-owner of Deardorff-Jackson Co. in
Camarillo and Fillmore, with 900 acres of lettuce, celery and
cauliflower.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it's more of an annoyance and a disruption, but
if it goes on too much longer it's going to
be a problem."
