A record-shattering storm slammed Southern California for a
sixth straight day Tuesday, triggering mudslides and tornadoes and forcing
more road closures, but forecasters predicted it would wane Wednesday
before a new storm moves in Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Officials put the statewide death toll from the current storms at
nine, while damage mounted into the tens of millions of
dollars. Six deaths were reported in Southern California, three in
Northern California.
</P>
<P>
Still, there was hope for a reprieve today from what already
has become the fourth-wettest year on record.
</P>
<P>
"It is still spawning some showers and some thunderstorms, but it's
not going to be continuous rain for everyone, everywhere," said
Jayme Laber, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service in
Oxnard. "You might even see some blue skies."
</P>
<P>
Sagging, sodden hillsides collapsed throughout the city Tuesday, sending homes skidding
down slopes and causing a swimming pool to slide into
a neighboring home in Bel-Air.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's damage toll added to the death and devastation seen earlier
in the storm. Two men died in the San Fernando
Valley, including Rory Shaw, 47, a Los Angeles civil engineer
who died after being swept into sinkhole in Sun Valley,
and Robert Wickham, 61, who died when a mudslide ripped
into the bedroom of his home in Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
Other Southern California deaths include 16-year-old Caitlin Oto, who was killed
in the rural Silverado Canyon area east of Irvine when
large boulders crashed into a wall as she did her
homework, and three others who died in traffic crashes in
San Bernardino and San Diego counties.
</P>
<P>
The storm has brought more than 9 inches of rain to
Hansen Dam and Chatsworth Reservoir, exceeding the normal rainfall for
an entire season. More than 8 inches of rain has
fallen in Van Nuys and downtown Los Angeles since Thursday.
Between 16 inches and 21 inches of rain has fallen
in the local foothills and mountains.
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, the flood-swollen Santa Clara River devoured part of
the runway at Santa Paula Airport, adding to an estimated
$5 million in damage suffered in the January storms.
</P>
<P>
"It ate away a good portion of our airport," said Pat
Quinn, the airport's emergency director. "We've lost about 200 feet
of runway so far, and it's not the end of
the runway, it's in the middle. We're in big trouble
here."
</P>
<P>
Roads throughout Los Angeles and Ventura counties remained closed by mudslides
Tuesday, and train service between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara,
suspended by a mudslide in Moorpark, will not resume until
at least Thursday, Amtrak officials said.
</P>
<P>
Storms have caused $52.5 million in damage to Los Angeles County
roads and facilities since the beginning of the year, said
Donald Wolf, interim director of the Public Works Department.
</P>
<P>
The county has spent $9 million on repairs, including $500,000 since
the weekend, Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
The storm has also stretched emergency workers nearly to the limit.
</P>
<P>
"We've rescued a number of people from their cars because of
flooding, we've dealt with trees down, we've dealt with high-tension
lines down, we've had to shut down gas lines, pretty
much everything you can imagine," said Jim Wells, a spokesman
for the Los Angeles Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
City inspectors have condemned 23 homes because of storm damage, and
69 others have been yellow-tagged, meaning they can be occupied
only during daytime hours, said Linda Aparicio, a spokeswoman for
the city's Public Works Department.
</P>
<P>
Residents will have only the barest reprieve before a new storm
system rolls into the region this weekend, Laber said. Another
storm is expected next week.
</P>
<P>
More than 33 inches of rain has fallen in downtown Los
Angeles since July 1, the fourth-wettest winter on record and
just over 5 inches shy of the record set in
the winter of 1883-84.
</P>
<P>
"We're closing in on some all-time rainfall totals here," Laber said.
"And we still have March."
</P>
<P>
Mayor James Hahn called on the state on Tuesday to extend
the state of emergency to help clean up.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are going to be shocked to find
out their insurance doesn't cover this damage," Hahn said. "That's
why it's important for us to extend the emergency period
to make funds available."
</P>
<P>
Hahn sent a letter to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to make the
declaration, which is the first step in getting federal aid
to the area.
</P>
<P>
Hahn estimated the city has suffered an additional $10 million in
damage from the past week of storms. Earlier storm damage
was estimated at some $80 million.
</P>
<P>
Hahn toured several areas of the city hardest hit by the
storms and noted it caused so much damage to some
areas that homeowners might not be able to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
The yawning sinkhole on Tujunga Avenue in Sun Valley that began
as a pothole grew to a 150-foot-diameter, 30-foot-deep crater Tuesday,
and it was unclear when city officials would be able
to begin repairs.
</P>
<P>
City Public Works spokeswoman Cora Jackson Fossett said crews can't fully
investigate the site until rains subside.
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Tony Cardenas, whose district includes the site, said theories
point to a cracked underground pipe that initially caused the
earth to give way.
</P>
<P>
The problem intensified, he said, as soil flowed underground to a
former gravel pit next door.
</P>
<P>
"Eventually the material started escaping into there," Cardenas said. "That's why
the hole is growing so large."
</P>
<P>
Without a storm-water collection system in that area, water continued to
pummel the area instead of getting diverted, he said.
