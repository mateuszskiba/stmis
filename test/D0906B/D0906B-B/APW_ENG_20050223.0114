Californians braced for even more rain as they struggled to recover from storms
that have left at least nine people dead, triggered mudslides and tornadoes, and
washed away roads and runways.
</P>
<P>
Among the victims was a Nevada woman caught in an avalanche while cross-country
skiing near Lake Tahoe, and a 16-year-old Orange County girl doing homework on a
computer when a mudslide crashed through the wall of her home.

In Ventura County, officials closed the small Santa Paula airport Tuesday after
more than 155 feet (46.5 meters) of runway collapsed into the rushing Santa
Clara River. Chunks of concrete crumbled into the water throughout the
day.
</P>
<P>
"We've lost nearly the entire west third of the airport," said Rowena Mason,
president of the Santa Paula Airport Association. "This is millions and millions
of dollars worth of damage."
</P>
<P>
Rescues occurred across the state, including a woman who was pulled Tuesday from
rushing, waist-high waters of the Rio Hondo River in Montebello.
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said another strong system expected early Wednesday could bring
severe winds and drop an additional inch or more of rain on Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
Despite brief glimpses of sun, a flash flood watch was in effect across much of
Southern California on Tuesday. A tornado warning was also issued for coastal
areas.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said dozens of homes were evacuated or red-tagged _ marked as
uninhabitable _ because they threatened to collapse from sliding
hillsides.
</P>
<P>
Mudslides forced Amtrak officials to suspend train service north of Los Angeles
to Santa Barbara at least through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The wild weather came from a series of storms that began battering the state on
Thursday, dumping 8.15 inches (20.7 centimeters) of rain on downtown Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
A total of 33.09 inches ( 84.05 centimeters) of rain has fallen in the city
since July 1, when California begins its yearly rainfall measurements. The
record, 38.18 inches (96.98 centimeters), was set in 1883-1884.

Storms have caused $52.5 million (euro39.8 million) in damage to Los Angeles
County roads and facilities since the beginning of the year. The county has
spent $9 million (euro6.8 million) on repairs, including $500,000 (euro378,989)
since the weekend, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Mayor James Hahn asked Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to urge President George W.
Bush to issue a federal disaster declaration for the city, which could open the
way for federal assistance. The mayor said damage exceeded $10 million (euro7.84
million).
</P>
<P>
Northern California also was hit by severe thunderstorms and hail. Trees were
uprooted and roofs and fences damaged by two small tornadoes near
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
Rain in Northern California tapered off Tuesday, with only isolated showers
expected by Wednesday, said Bob Benjamin, a NWS forecaster.
