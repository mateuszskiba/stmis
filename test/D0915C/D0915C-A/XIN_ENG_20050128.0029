<TEXT>
<P>
Insurgents killed at least 19 
Iraqis and bombed  polling stations on Thursday in a fierce 
campaign to wreck Sunday's general elections.
</P>
<P>
With the election only three days away, violence has been 
escalating. The flurry of attacks, following a helicopter crash 
that killed 31 US troops on Wednesday, were concentrated on the 
heartland of Iraq' minority Sunnis.
</P>
<P>
In the deadliest attack on Thursday, a car bomb hit an Iraqi 
army patrol near a polling station in Samarra, a mainly Sunni 
Muslim city. Seven Iraqis were killed and five others wounded, 
police said.
</P>
<P>
In Baquba, 60 km northeast of the capital Baghdad, a suicide 
car bomb hit the headquarters of a provincial government, killing 
five people.
</P>
<P>
South of Baghdad, in the so-called triangle of death, a 
homemade bomb killed five Iraqis and injured 15 on the road 
between Mahmudiyah and Latifiyah.
</P>
<P>
Gunmen killed a policeman in an attack in Musayyib, south of 
Baghdad, and a roadside bomb killed a police officer in Baiji.
</P>
<P>
One US Marine was killed in action and four others wounded 
while conducting security and stability operations in Babil 
Province, according to the US military.
</P>
<P>
Three small bomb blasts occurred at polling stations in Iraq's 
southern city of Basra on Thursday, but no one was hurt, according
to a British army spokesman.
</P>
<P>
With about 40 polling stations destroyed by insurgents, even 
the distribution of ballot boxes for Iraq's 13 million eligible 
voters, about half of the country's population, underscored the 
grim security situation.
</P>
<P>
In the Shiite holy city of Najaf, Iraqi police, US troops and 
Iraqi security forces sealed off an area within a one-kilometer 
perimeter around a school to be used as a polling station when 
ballot papers were brought in.
</P>
<P>
Several guerrilla groups, including a faction led by Abu Musab 
al-Zarqawi, have declared war on the poll, vowing to kill anyone 
who votes.
</P>
<P>
The militant group Army of Ansar al-Sunna issued a "final 
warning," saying anyone who votes would be marked for death, 
either during or after the election.
</P>
<P>
"Those who don't pay heed will have only themselves to blame," 
the group said in a statement on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The faction led by al-Qaida ally Abu Musab al-Zarqawi said 
Thursday on a website that it had executed a candidate of interim 
Prime Minister Iyad Allawi's party and a video would be released 
later.
</P>
<P>
In the past two months, 22 members of Allawi's party were 
killed, according to party official Imad Shbib.
</P>
<P>
In the countdown to the election, the Iraqi security forces 
bore the brunt of the attacks. While US forces worked to quell the
insurgency, the US State Department has asserted that Iraqis will 
take "paramount" responsibility in providing security for the 
election.
</P>
<P>
"I think you will see on Election Day that most of the security
is being provided by the Iraqis and the Iraqi forces," said State 
Department spokesman Richard Boucher.
</P>
<P>
Boucher said US President George W. Bush was confident that the
world would recognize the legitimacy of the election despite 
worries that it would be marred by a boycott by Sunni Muslims and 
violence.
</P>
<P>
US military commanders and Iraqi officials predict that 
violence will flare up as insurgents attempt spectacular new 
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, US President Bush and interim Iraqi President Ghazi 
al-Yawar on Thursday discussed efforts to get Iraqis to vote 
despite growing violence. This was the seventh conversation that 
Bush has had with Iraqi leaders since the beginning of 2003.
</P>
<P>
Despite Bush's confidence in the election, Turkish Prime 
Minister Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday that the election would 
not be fully democratic since one major ethnic group is to be 
absent.
</P>
<P>
Russia, a major player in the arena of world politics, said on 
Thursday that it would not send observers to monitor the election 
due to the security situation there.
