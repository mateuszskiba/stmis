<P>
Insurgents set off a car bomb and 
attacked voting stations and security forces in several Iraqi cities 
Friday, killing at least six people as campaigning for the election 
wrapped up and voters began casting their ballots abroad.
</P>
<P>
Four people were killed in a suicide car bomb attack at a power 
station in the southern Baghdad neighbourhood of Dura, police and 
medical sources said.
</P>
<P>
"At around 9:00 am (0600 GMT), a black GMC approached the 
checkpoint at the entrance of the power plant. There was only a 
driver inside the car, his face was masked," a policeman who 
witnessed the attack told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"He was stopped at the checkpoint and a few seconds later, the 
explosion went off. We lost three comrades and one civilian was also 
killed in the blast," said the policeman.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking from Baghdad's Yarmuk hospital, where medical 
sources at the emergency department confirmed the death toll and 
added that three others policemen and a civilian were also wounded 
in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Campaigning by candidates for Sunday's election officially ended 
on Friday morning, as Iraqi exiles in 14 countries across the globe 
began voting.
</P>
<P>
Insurgents, including Al-Qaeda frontman Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, 
have vowed to wreck the country's first democratic vote in decades.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi authorities have ordered tough security measures, 
including a curfew, sealing off the borders and the closure of 
Baghdad international airport from Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But they have also warned that the insurgent violence will 
pursue right through the election weekend and beyond.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi policeman was killed and two civilians wounded in a 
host of attacks on buildings to be used as voting stations around 
Kirkuk, 250 kilometers (150 miles) north of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The policeman was shot dead by attackers as he stood guard at 
one voting station in the east of the city, police told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Kirkuk has a divided population of Kurds, Arabs, Turkmans and 
other smaller minorities and has seen mounting violence this week.
</P>
<P>
A car bomb attack went off near a school to be used as a polling 
station in the same Baghad neighbourhood where the power station was 
targeted.
</P>
<P>
A police officer said the blast had caused material damage but 
no casualties.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi soldier was killed and another wounded when their 
patrol vehicle went over a mine near Samarra, in the Sunni Triangle 
north of Baghdad, police said.
</P>
<P>
Other attacks were reported in the triangle. One man was wounded 
in an attack on another polling station at Al-Dur and another 
civilian was injured in a mortar attack on a voting centre in 
Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of voting stations have been attacked by insurgents who 
have put up posters and handed out leaflets warning Iraqis not to 
vote.
</P>
<P>
US soldiers also discovered three makeshift bombs in Baghdad 
Friday.
