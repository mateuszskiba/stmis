FALLUJAH, Iraq, Jan. 30 (Xinhua)

In a sharp contrast to the 
rest of Iraq, no citizens went to the only voting center in the 
battle-ravaged city of Fallujah on Sunday, a Xinhua correspondent 
said.
</P>
<P>
"No one headed to the voting center till now, and most people 
here said they were afraid of US soldiers densely deployed in the 
city," he said.
</P>
<P>
With loud speakers, US marines kept on calling on local people 
to go to the polling station, but the much alienated Fallujans 
apparently declined to do so.
</P>
<P>
US and Iraqi forces stormed the city last November to clear it 
of insurgents, forcing some 200,000 citizens to take refuge in 
makeshift tents in nearby villages.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the election day, two more polling centers, in al-
Risala and al-Shurta districts, were set up in an effort to leave 
an impression that no province will be marginalized in the 
elections.
</P>
<P>
The vast Anbar province, where Fallujah is situated, has not 
seen any electoral advertisement. Insurgents have in the past days 
targeted polling centers instead.
</P>
<P>
People believed that the interim government could not even open 
a voting center as it would be an easy target for armed groups 
widespread in the territory.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's nationwide polls opened on Sunday morning, ushering in 
a new course of the oil-rich but violence-shattered country.
</P>
<P>
The 275-seat National Assembly will be formed by proportional 
representation of votes with a one-year mandate. It will choose a 
transitional government and draft a permanent constitution put for 
a national referendum by Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
A new government and parliament will then be elected through 
another ballot by the end of this year under the guidance of the 
constitution.
