US Senator John Kerry told US 
television Thursday that the fate of kidnapped US journalist Jill 
Carroll has overshadowed his visit to Iraq, becoming one of top 
issues discussed at his meetings with senior Iraqi officials.

The former Democratic presidential candidate, on a 12 day trip 
to Asia and the Middle East, told CNN television that he has held 
numerous discussions with top Iraqi officials in Iraq, including 
President Jalal Talabani, at which the fate of the missing US 
newspaper journalist was raised.

"Every single effort possible that can be made is being made to 
try to locate her, to try to find out what is going on ... to try to 
deal with this issue," Kerry said, as the clock ran down on a threat 
by kidnappers to execute Carroll.
</P>
<P>
"This young reporter, by all reputation over here in Baghdad, is 
somebody who has the interest of the Iraqi people at heart," he 
said.
</P>
<P>
Carroll was seized in Baghdad on January 7, by gunmen who 
threatened to kill her on Friday unless all Iraqi women in US 
military custody are released.

<P>
"My thoughts have been with her every single minute that I've 
been here," Kerry said from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to be here and know that this is going on," he said.

<P>
The Democratic senator is on a tour of several countries, 
including Iraq and Afghanistan, to assess progress in the US "war on 
terror".

His itinerary also includes Pakistan, Jordan, Kuwait, Israel and 
India.
