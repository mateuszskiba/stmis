The mother of a US journalist 
abducted in Iraq made an impassioned plea for her release Thursday 
as the clock ran down on a threat by the kidnappers to execute her 
daughter.
</P>
<P>
Mary Beth Carroll said a video of her daughter Jill taken by her 
captors had given the family hope that she was still alive, though 
it "has also shaken us about her fate."
</P>
<P>
Jill Carroll was seized by gunmen in Baghdad on January 7. They 
have threatened to kill her on Friday unless all Iraqi women in US 
military custody are released.
</P>
<P>
"I, her father and her sister are appealing directly to her 
captors to release this young woman, who has worked so hard to show 
the suffering of Iraqis," Carroll's mother said, reading the 
family's prepared statement on CNN television.
</P>
<P>
"Taking vengeance on my innocent daughter, who loved Iraq and 
its people, will not create justice. To her captors, I say that 
Jill's welfare depends upon you, and so we call upon you to ensure 
that Jill is returned safely home to her family, who needs her and 
loves her."
</P>
<P>
Carroll also pleaded with the captors to "work with Jill to find 
a way to contact us with the honorable intent of discussing her 
release."
</P>
<P>
On the video broadcast Tuesday by the Al-Jazeera Arabic 
television station, the 28-year-old freelance reporter, wearing a 
grey sweatshirt, with her long brown hair loose, was shown alone and 
speaking, but there was no sound. It was the first time she had been 
seen since her disappearance.
</P>
<P>
In Iraq on Wednesday, a justice ministry official said that six 
Iraqi women detainees were to be freed in the coming days. US forces 
had earlier said they were holding eight Iraqi women because they 
presented "an imperative threat" to the security of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jill Carroll arrived in Iraq in 2003 and worked for a variety of 
news organisations from several different countries. She began 
filing stories for the Christian Science Monitor, her current 
newspaper, early last year.
</P>
<P>
Her mother told CNN that Jill had traveled to the region to get 
a sense of the terrain and the culture ahead of the war.
</P>
<P>
"We could see the war was coming in Iraq, and she didn't want to 
be a parachute journalist, somebody who just comes in ... quickly. 
She wanted to get to the Middle East early, learn about the people 
of Iraq, learn about the culture and the customs and the politics, 
so she could report well and accurately."
</P>
<P>
She said they had also discussed the possibility of her being 
kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
"I told her frankly how I felt if she would be kidnapped, and 
supporting her and knowing that she was doing what she loved and 
what she thought was very important to do, and that that would give 
me and her family comfort at this time -- and it does," Mary Beth 
Carroll told CNN.
</P>
<P>
She added: "I think she was a wonderful ambassador, is a 
wonderful ambassador, to the United States" for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
"We know she's a strong woman and that her strength of character 
and her mind will get her through this," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Party, Iraq's main Sunni Arab party, called Thursday 
for Carroll to be released "as quickly as possible" and condemned 
"the abduction of innocent people."
</P>
<P>
A similar appeal came from the Washington-based Council on 
American-Islamic Relations, which said it was sending a delegation 
to Baghdad to make a public plea for Carroll's release.
</P>
<P>
"No cause can be served by harming those who only seek to convey 
the human suffering caused by war," the organisation said in a 
statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the media watchdog Reporters Without Borders, 
Carroll is the 35th media worker to be kidnapped in Iraq since the 
start of the war.
</P>
<P>
Five of the kidnapping victims -- four Iraqis and Enzo Baldoni 
of Italy -- were killed by their abductors. The others were all 
released safe and sound.
