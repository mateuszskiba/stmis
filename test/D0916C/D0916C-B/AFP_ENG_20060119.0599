The Pentagon said Thursday the 
release of female detainees from US military-run facilities in Iraq 
is not imminent despite threats by kidnappers to kill an American 
journalist held hostage.
</P>
<P>
Kidnappers on Tuesday threatened to kill 28-year-old freelance 
reporter Jill Carroll if the United States failed to meet a 72-hour 
deadline to free all female prisoners.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any information on any imminent releases," said 
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's justice ministry said Wednesday that six of eight women 
detainees held by US forces would be released within days, but it 
denied there was any link with the kidnappers' demands.
</P>
<P>
"I have no insight on that," Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
He said fewer than 10 Iraqi women were held in facilities run by 
the US military in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraqi-US review boards periodically assess whether 
prisoners, male or female, no longer pose a threat and should be 
released.
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, a US military spokesman said some female detainees 
may be released "in accordance with the normal process."
</P>
<P>
"But they won't be released as a response to a demand by 
terrorists and criminal agents," said Brigadier General Donald 
Alston. "We don't negotiate with terrorists and criminals."
