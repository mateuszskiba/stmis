<P>
A leading US-based Islamic 
rights group on Wednesday announced it was sending representatives 
to Baghdad seeking the release of Jill Carroll, the US journalist 
abducted in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Carroll's captors have threatened to kill her unless the United 
States freed all female prisoners in Iraq within 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Qatar-based Arabic television station Al-Jazeera 
showed a videotape of Carroll taken by her kidnappers, who issued 
their execution ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations 
(CAIR) said in a statement that because of the short deadline its 
delegation will hold a press conference late Thursday in Amman "to 
make a public appeal to the kidnappers for Carroll's freedom."
</P>
<P>
CAIR also plans a press conference in Carroll's home state of 
Michigan with local Muslim leaders to call for her release.
</P>
<P>
The group plans a second press conference in Baghdad on Friday, 
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
CAIR earlier issued a statement -- translated into Arabic and 
distributed to Middle Eastern media outlets -- calling for Carroll's 
"immediate and unconditional" release.
</P>
<P>
Carroll, 28, arrived in Iraq in 2003 and has been filing stories 
for the Christian Science Monitor newspaper since early last year.
</P>
<P>
Carroll was seized by gunmen in Baghdad on January 7. Her 
interpreter was shot dead during the abduction, while her driver got 
away.
