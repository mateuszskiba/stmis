An American Muslim advocacy group is traveling to the Middle East to plead for
the safe return of a journalist facing death at the hands of her
kidnappers.

<P>
The Council on American-Islamic Relations is planning to hold one news
conference Thursday in Amman, Jordan, and another Friday in Baghdad. The group
hopes to reach Arab television audiences and convince the captors of Jill
Carroll, a freelancer for the Boston-based Christian Science Monitor, to release
her.

"We're taking a serious step on behalf of our community, and we are hopeful that
our words will be heard and our appeal will be listened to," said Nihad Awad,
executive director of CAIR. "We have been reading about her work ... and though
we don't know her, we know it is wrong to kidnap people and hurt innocent
people."

Carroll, 28, was kidnapped Jan. 7 in one of Baghdad's most dangerous
neighborhoods. She was being driven to meet a Sunni Arab politician, who failed
to appear for the interview. Carroll's translator was killed, but her driver
escaped.

The group claiming responsibility has threatened to kill Carroll on Friday
unless all Iraqi women in military custody are released. A U.S. military
spokeswoman, Sgt. Stacy Simon, said eight Iraqi women are currently detained.
She provided no further details.

<P>
White House spokesman Scott McClellan said Wednesday that Carroll's "safe return
is a priority" and he did not want to talk about it further because of the
sensitivity of the situation.

CAIR, based in Washington, works to promote a positive image of Islam and
Muslims in the United States.
