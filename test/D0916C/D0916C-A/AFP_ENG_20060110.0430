 Angry Sunni Arabs protested 
Tuesday at a raid on a Baghdad mosque by US and Iraqi soldiers 
looking for a kidnapped US woman reporter, the latest victim in a 
series of abductions of Westerners in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration came as Iraqis celebrated the Muslim Eid 
Al-Adha holiday a day after a twin suicide bombing at the interior 
ministry, claimed by Al-Qaeda, that left at least 28 policemen 
dead.
</P>
<P>
Waving banners and chanting anti-US slogans, about 700 people 
rallied in the gardens of the Umm al-Qura mosque in the west of the 
capital to denounce the Saturday night raid.
</P>
<P>
"The attack on the Umm al-Qura mosque is an attack on Muslims 
and Islam," read one of the banners at the protest.
</P>
<P>
The US military said the raid was linked to the hunt for 
kidnapped Jill Carroll, a freelance journalist working for the 
Christian Science Monitor.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant Colonel Barry Johnson, a US military spokesman, said 
the raid was ordered "as a direct result of a tip by an Iraqi 
civilian that activities related to the kidnapping were being 
carried out inside the mosque."
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old reporter was seized by gunmen on Saturday after 
calling by the office of a prominent Sunni politician in the 
neighbourhood.
</P>
<P>
Her interpreter, Allan Enwiyah, 32, was shot dead and his body 
abandoned nearby, while her driver got away.
</P>
<P>
"Both Iraqi and coalition forces raided the mosque in the early 
morning hours in order to minimize the impact on worshippers and the 
surrounding neighborhood," Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
Six people were detained for questioning, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Sunni Committee of Muslim Scholars which is based at the 
mosque, confirmed that one of its members, Yunis Aikali, and five 
mosque guards were arrested in the raid.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the committee also accused US soldiers of 
desecrating the mosque and carrying away files containing the names 
of members.
</P>
<P>
"We call on the occupiers to withdraw from Iraq because they are 
the reason for every crime and the death of every innocent in Iraq," 
Harith al-Aubaidi, a member of the committee said in his sermon at 
the prayers ahead of the protest.
</P>
<P>
Ashraf Qazi, the UN special representative in Iraq, also 
deplored the raid.
</P>
<P>
"This again underlines the importance of all parties respecting 
the sanctity of holy sites and places of worship," he said in a 
statement.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi security forces, meanwhile, were on alert in western 
Baghdad looking for hostages, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The US embassy said it had nothing new to report on Carroll.
</P>
<P>
The Christian Science Monitor said it was urgently seeking 
information about its reporter after confirming her abduction on 
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Carroll's driver, quoted in a story posted on the Monitor's 
website, said gunmen jumped in front of the car, pulled him from it, 
and drove off with their two captives all within 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Several Westerners are currently being held hostage by 
insurgents in Iraq, including an American, a Briton and two 
Canadians who are members of a Christian peace group.
</P>
<P>
Carroll was the 31st media worker to have been kidnapped in Iraq 
since the start of the war in 2003, according to watchdog group 
Reporters without Borders.
</P>
<P>
Five of the journalist kidnap victims -- four Iraqis and Enzo 
Baldoni of Italy -- were killed by their abductors. The others were 
released.
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Bernard Planche, a 52-year-old engineer, held hostage 
for over a month and who managed to evade his captors on Saturday, 
was debriefed Tuesday by the DGSE foreign intelligence agency at a 
base near the Loire Valley city of Orleans.
</P>
<P>
In other developments, a Polish soldier was wounded and two 
rebels killed during a raid carried out by coalition forces near the 
town of Hamza, south of Baghdad, Poland's PAP news agency reported 
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Coalition forces captured four suspects wanted over the killing 
of a Spanish officer in 2004.
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, two policemen were killed and two wounded in 
separate shooting incidents Tuesday, security officials said.
</P>
<P>
In Spain itself, police arrested 20 people across the country, 
mostly Moroccans, suspected of recruiting radical Islamist 
volunteers to fight in Iraq, national radio said.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, a new study co-authored by a Nobel Prize 
winning economist, claimed that -- in addition to the human cost of 
the war, with 2,209 US servicemen killed and over 16,000 wounded -- 
the Iraq campaign will likely cost the United States anywhere 
between one and two trillion dollars.
