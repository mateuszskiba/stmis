 The Christian Science Monitor 
newspaper on Monday pleaded for the release of American reporter 
Jill Carroll, seized in Baghdad by abductors who gunned down her 
Iraqi translator.
</P>
<P>
Carroll, 28, a freelancer filing for the 
Boston,Massachusetts-based paper, was abducted in western Baghdad on 
Saturday, apparently on the way to interview a prominent Sunni 
politician.
</P>
<P>
"We are urgently seeking information about Ms. Carroll and are 
pursuing every avenue to secure her release," said Monitor editor 
Richard Bergenheim.
</P>
<P>
"The Monitor joins Jill's colleagues -- Iraqi and foreign -- in 
the Baghdad press in calling for her immediate and safe release," 
the paper said in a statement which named Carroll for the first 
time.
</P>
<P>
The incident was reported from Baghdad by AFP on Saturday, but 
the agency, in common with other foreign and US news outlets, did 
not identify Carroll in line with a Monitor request as efforts were 
launched to find her.
</P>
<P>
Carroll had reported from the Middle East for Jordanian, Italian 
and other news organizations for the last three years, the paper 
said.
</P>
<P>
"In recent months, the Monitor has tapped into her 
professionalism, energy, and fair reporting on the Iraqi scene," the 
Monitor statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It was her drive to gather direct and accurate views from 
political leaders that took her into western Baghdad's Adil 
neighborhood on Saturday morning."
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted unidentified relatives of Carroll as pleading 
for her release and asking her captors to "consider the work she has 
done to reveal the truth about the Iraq war."
</P>
<P>
In a dispatch for the American Journalism Review published last 
year, Carroll wrote that she moved to Jordan ahead of the US 
invasion of Iraq in 2003 to get a feel for the story.
</P>
<P>
"All I ever wanted to be was a foreign correspondent," she 
wrote.
</P>
<P>
"So when I was laid off from my reporting assistant job at the 
Wall Street Journal in August 2002, it seemed the right time to try 
to make it happen.         "There was bound to be plenty of 
parachute journalism once the war started, and I didn't want to be a 
part of that."
</P>
<P>
Officials in Baghdad and the Monitor said Carroll was seized as 
she was on her way to interview prominent Sunni Arab politician 
Adnan al-Dulaimi.
</P>
<P>
The body of her interpreter, Allan Enwiyah, 32, was later found 
in the same neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi defence ministry official said Enwiyah was able to tell 
soldiers that Carroll had been kidnapped before he died.
</P>
<P>
Carroll's driver, quoted in a story posted on the Monitor's 
website on Monday, said gunmen jumped in front of her car screaming 
"Stop! Stop! Stop!" and others jumped in and surrounded Carroll and 
Enwiyah.
</P>
<P>
"They didn't give me any time to even put the car in neutral," 
the driver, who requested anonymity, said.
</P>
<P>
"It was very obvious this was by design. The whole operation 
took no more than a quarter of a minute. It was very highly 
organized. It was a setup, a perfect ambush."
</P>
<P>
A guard outside Dulaimi's office told AFP on Saturday he heard 
gunshots fired a short distance away and rushed to find the body of 
a slain man.
</P>
<P>
Dulaimi however told AFP he had no appointment to meet a Western 
journalist.
</P>
<P>
Several Westerners are currently being held hostage by 
insurgents in Iraq, including an American, a Briton and two 
Canadians who are members of a Christian peace group.
</P>
<P>
Carroll is the 31st media worker to have been kidnapped in Iraq 
since the start of the war in 2003, according to watchdog group 
Reporters without Borders (Reporters sans Frontieres, or RSF).
</P>
<P>
Five of the kidnap victims -- four Iraqis and Enzo Baldoni of 
Italy  -- were killed by their abductors. The others were released.
</P>
<P>
RSF renewed its call for Carroll's release on Monday, and 
bemoaned the dangers faced by reporters in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"Journalists working in Iraq have once again been caught in a 
deadly ambush," the group said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The interpreters death confirms that the Iraqi press continues 
to be the chief victim of the infernal climate for the media in this 
country."
