<P>
Jury selection began Tuesday for the second trial of two former top Tyco
International Ltd. executives charged with looting the company of $600 million
(euro459 million) to subsidize their lavish lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors promised to present a leaner case this time against former Tyco
chairman and CEO L. Dennis Kozlowski and former chief financial officer Mark
Swartz.
</P>
<P>
In the first trial, prosecutors played a videotape of the $2 million (euro1.53
million) birthday party Kozlowski threw for his wife on a Mediterranean island,
and a video tour through his $18 million (euro14 million) Fifth Avenue
apartment.
</P>
<P>
This time around, prosecutors were expected to focus less on items such as
Kozlowski's $6,000 (euro4,600) gold-threaded shower curtain and more on how he
and Swartz allegedly looted the company.
</P>
<P>
The retrial is expected to last about four months.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski, 58, and Swartz, 44, are charged with grand larceny, falsifying
business records, conspiracy and business law violations.
</P>
<P>
The defendants each face up to 30 years in prison if convicted of the most
serious charges.
</P>
<P>
Their first trial, which lasted six months, was aborted last year because of a
menacing letter and telephone call to a juror.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski and Swartz are accused of stealing $170 million (euro130 million) by
hiding unauthorized bonuses and secretly forgiving loans to themselves, and
pocketing $430 million (euro329 million) more by pumping up Tyco stock with lies
about the state of the company's finances.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers said Kozlowski and Swartz earned every penny they got from
Tyco.
</P>
<P>
The judge has already thrown out the top charge in the original indictment _
enterprise corruption. That count suggested that Kozlowski and Swartz had
conspired with others to turn Tyco into a criminal enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Tyco, which has about 270,000 employees and $36 billion (euro27.6 billion) in
annual revenue, makes a wide range of products including electronics, medical
supplies and security devices. The company is based in Bermuda. Its U.S.
headquarters is in West Windsor, New Jersey.
