<P>
The conservative Roman Catholic group Opus Dei, which enjoyed firm support from
the late Pope John Paul II, welcomed Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger's election
Tuesday as his successor.
</P>
<P>
Opus Dei's prelate, Bishop Javier Echevarria, issued a statement pledging
support for the new pontiff. "This is a time of great joy," Echevarria
said.
</P>
<P>
Opus Dei has what is called a "personal prelature", meaning it does not answer
to a local bishop.
</P>
<P>
Echevarria said "the new pope knows the mission of the prelature and knows he
can rely on the joyful dedication of the priests and lay people who compose it
to serve the church."
