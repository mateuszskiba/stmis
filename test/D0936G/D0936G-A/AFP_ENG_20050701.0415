after Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her retirement.

"Under the Constitution, I am responsible for nominating a 
sucessor for Justice O'Connor. I take this responsibility seriously. 
I will be deliberate and thorough in this process," Bush said.

"The nation deserves and I will select a Supreme Court Justice 
that Americans can be proud of," Bush said.

<P>
"The nation also deserves a dignified process of confirmation in 
the United States Senate, characterised by fair treatment, a fair 
hearing and a fair vote.
</P>
<P>
"I will chose a nominee in a timely manner so the hearing and 
the vote can be compelted before the new Supreme Court term 
begins."

Bush also paid tribute to O'Connor, the first woman to serve on 
the top US court.

<P>
"America is proud of Justice O'Connor's distinguished service 
and I am proud to know her," he said.
</P>
<P>
"She has been a discerning and conscientious judge and a public 
servant of complete integrity."
