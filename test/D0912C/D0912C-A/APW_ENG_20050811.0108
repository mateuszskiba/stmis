<P>
The mother of a U.S. soldier killed in Iraq who started a quiet roadside peace
vigil near President George Bush's ranch last weekend is drawing supporters from
across the nation.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of people have joined her and others have sent flowers and
food.
</P>
<P>
Cindy Sheehan, 48, of Vacaville, California, says she was surprised at the
response.
</P>
<P>
"Before my son was killed, I used to think that one person could not make a
difference," she said Wednesday under a tent where she has slept since Saturday.
"But one person that is surrounded and supported by millions of people can be
heard."
</P>
<P>
But Kristinn Taylor, co-leader of the Washington, D.C., chapter of
FreeRepublic.com, which has held pro-troop rallies, said Sheehan's actions are
misguided and hurt troop morale.
</P>
<P>
"She has a political agenda that goes way beyond her son's death in combat,"
Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
Although a few residents have complained about the protesters, no one has been
arrested because the group has been on the public right-of-way, said Capt.
Kenneth Vanek of the McLennan County Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, two high-level Bush administration officials, the national security
adviser and deputy White House chief of staff, talked to Sheehan for about 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Sheehan called the brief meeting "pointless" and still wants to talk to the
president.
</P>
<P>
Her 24-year-old son, Casey, was killed in Sadr City, Iraq, in April 2004 just
five days after he arrived. Two months later, Sheehan was among grieving
military family members who met with Bush at Fort Lewis, near Seattle,
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Since then, she said, various government and independent commission reports have
disputed the Bush administration's claims that Saddam Hussein had mass-killing
chemical and biological weapons _ a main justification for the March 2003
invasion.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a coalition of anti-war groups in Washington called on Bush to
speak with Sheehan, who they say has helped to unify the peace
movement.
</P>
<P>
"Cindy Sheehan has become the Rosa Parks of the anti-war movement," said Rev.
Lennox Yearwood, leader of the Hip Hop Caucus, an activist group. "She's tired,
fed up and she's not going to take it anymore, and so now we stand with
her."
</P>
<P>
Rosa Parks is the iconic civil rights figure who refused to give up her seat on
a segregated bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955. Her arrest triggered one of
the movement's earliest landmark events, a 381-day boycott of the bus system
organized by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
At her makeshift camp in muddy ditches off the two-lane, winding road leading to
Bush's ranch, Sheehan has spent the past several days talking to reporters,
hugging fellow protesters and taking brief breaks to eat sandwiches and fruit
brought by supporters. Her vigil has also become a hot topic on the Internet and
blogs.
</P>
<P>
Although she doesn't expect Bush to meet with her in Crawford, she says if he
did she would ask him whether he has encouraged his twin daughters to
enlist.
</P>
<P>
"I want him to quit using my son's death to justify more killing," she said.
"The only way he can honor my son's death is to bring the troops
home."
</P>
<P>
Sheehan, a former Roman Catholic youth minister, formed a group called Gold Star
Families For Peace earlier this year and has spoken out against the war across
the nation and overseas.
