Soldier's Mother Stages War Protest Outside Bush Ranch

<P>
Two senior White House aides met here on
Saturday with the angry mother of a fallen U.S. soldier, but they
rejected Cindy Sheehan's demand for a direct accounting from President
Bush for the way he has conducted the war in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The surprise meeting, which lasted about 45 minutes, took place on
a roadside several miles from the president's ranch, where federal and
local law enforcement officials had halted Sheehan's advance toward
the 1,600-acre estate. Bush is spending much of August on vacation at
the ranch.
</P>
<P>
Sheehan, a 48-year-old Vacaville, Calif., woman, was accompanied by
more than 50 placard-wielding anti-war activists. After police and
Secret Service agents halted their march on a country lane, Sheehan
and a half-dozen die-hard supporters stayed put while others turned
back, trudging slowly down Prairie Chapel Road under the hot Central
Texas sun.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview after her conversation with National
Security Adviser Stephen J. Hadley and White House deputy chief of
staff Joe Hagin, Sheehan said she would remain in Crawford and
continue to seek a meeting with Bush.
</P>
<P>
``I didn't change my mind at all,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
``They said the president really believed that Saddam Hussein had
weapons of mass destruction,'' Sheehan added. ``And I told them: `I
might be a grieving mom, but you men are very intelligent, and I know
you don't believe what you're telling me.'''
</P>
<P>
Hadley and Hagin said they would relay her sentiments to the
president, according to Sheehan.
</P>
<P>
Bush has met privately around the country with numerous family
members of soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, but not with
relatives who are overtly against the war.
</P>
<P>
``We mourn the loss of every life and Americans deeply appreciate
those who have made the supreme sacrifice. The way to honor that
sacrifice is to complete the mission so that their lives were not lost
in vain,'' said White House deputy press secretary Trent Duffy.
</P>
<P>
Sheehan's son, Casey, 24, was killed in the Sadr City section of
Baghdad on April 4, 2004. Afterward, she co-founded Gold Star Families
for Peace, an organization of people who have lost loved ones in Iraq
or who oppose the war. Previously, Sheehan was turned away while
trying to protest the war at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
She told reporters here that she not only opposes the war but also
strongly objects to Bush's assertions that fallen U.S. soldiers had
died ``for a noble cause.''
</P>
<P>
``I don't want him to use my son's name, or my name, to justify any
more killings. And I want to tell the president that, and I want to
ask the president why my son died,'' Sheehan said, contending that the
war was ``based on horrendous lies and deceptions.''
</P>
<P>
Her meeting with two of Bush's top aides came amid a spike in U.S.
casualties in Iraq, accompanied by sagging public support for the
president's conduct of the war.
</P>
<P>
A Newsweek poll released on Saturday found that 61 percent of
Americans now disapprove of Bush's handling of the war while 34
percent approve. This is Bush's lowest approval rating on Iraq and the
first time that it has dropped below 40 percent in the Newsweek Poll,
the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
Half of those polled said the United States is losing ground in its
efforts to establish security and democracy in Iraq while 40 percent
said the United States is making progress there.
