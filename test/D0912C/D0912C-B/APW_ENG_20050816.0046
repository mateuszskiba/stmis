<P>
The husband of Cindy Sheehan, the mother camped outside President George Bush's
Texas ranch to protest the death of a son in the Iraq war, has filed for
divorce, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Sheehan filed the divorce petition Friday in Solano County court,
northeast of San Francisco. His lawyer did not immediately return a call seeking
comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
The couple's eldest child, Casey, 24, was an Army soldier killed in April 2004.
Cindy Sheehan has said the stress of the death led to the separation of the
couple, who were high school sweethearts.
</P>
<P>
Sheehan has vowed to remain in Texas through Bush's August vacation, unless he
meets with her. She began her protest 10 days ago and has since been joined by
more than 100 anti-war activists.
</P>
<P>
"Our message is to bring the troops home," Sheehan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The White House on Monday again issued a statement saying that Bush sympathizes
with Sheehan. The president has given no indication that he will meet with
her.
</P>
<P>
Sheehan, 48, and other grieving military families met with Bush in June 2004 at
Fort Lewis, near Seattle, two months after her son's death.
</P>
<P>
But she says the meeting was unsatisfactory, and it came before reports surfaced
about faulty pre-war intelligence, which enraged her.
