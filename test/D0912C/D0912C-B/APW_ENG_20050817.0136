Bush neighbor allows war protesters to camp on his land

CRAWFORD, Texas

<TEXT>
<P>
One of President George W. Bush's neighbors will allow use of his land by dozens
of war protesters who have camped in roadside ditches the past 11 days, giving
them more room and halving their distance from Bush's ranch.
</P>
<P>
Fred Mattlage, an Army veteran, said he sympathizes with the demonstrators whose
makeshift camp off the winding, two-lane road leading to Bush's ranch has
angered most residents. Mattlage said the group will be safer on his corner
1-acre lot (0.4-hectare).
</P>
<P>
"I just think people should have a right to protest without being harassed,"
Mattlage told The Associated Press Tuesday night. "And I'm against the war. I
don't think it's a war we need to be in."
</P>
<P>
Cindy Sheehan of Vacaville, California, started the vigil Aug. 6 to honor her
son Casey, who was killed in Iraq last year. Sheehan has vowed to remain through
Bush's monthlong ranch visit unless he meets with her and other grieving
families.
</P>
<P>
Mattlage's Monday night offer, accepted by protesters Tuesday, will put them
about a mile from Bush's ranch, said Hadi Jawad of the Crawford Peace House,
which is helping the group.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators said they would start moving their tents, anti-war banners and
portable toilets to the new site Wednesday and hope to have the new camp set up
in time for a dusk candlelight vigil.
</P>
<P>
The vigil will be one of about 1,000 to be held across the country, an effort
organized by liberal advocacy groups MoveOn.org Political Action, TrueMajority
and Democracy for America.
</P>
<P>
Larry Mattlage, a distant cousin of Mattlage's who owns nearby land, fired a
shotgun twice into the air Sunday but no one was injured. But Fred Mattlage does
not share his cousin's frustrations with the group.
</P>
<P>
For more than a week, the rural area has been a traffic nightmare as the camp
attracted hundreds more protesters as well as Bush supporters holding
counter-rallies.
</P>
<P>
A resident was arrested Monday night after authorities say he ran over hundreds
of small wooden crosses bearing names of fallen U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday morning, several landowners asked county commissioners to extend for at
least two miles (3.2 kilometers) the public "no parking" zone around Bush's
ranch. The ordinance now prohibits cars from stopping on the road within about a
quarter of a mile.
</P>
<P>
Bush, who said he sympathizes with Sheehan, has made no indication that he will
meet with her. Sheehan and other families met with Bush two months after her
son's death before she became a vocal opponent of the war.
