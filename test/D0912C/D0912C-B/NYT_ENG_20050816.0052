COMMENTARY: SHEEHAN JUSTIFIED IN BOTHERING BUSH
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cindy Sheehan, the grieving and hustling mother who has stalked President
Bush to his sagebrush getaway, has acquired public relations advisers,
no less. The acquisition seems superfluous.
</P>
<P>
Sheehan herself could hire out as a PR consultant. Experience pays
off.
</P>
<P>
Sheehan had been working her way across the country with little
to show, beyond the old anti-war fan base, for her
effort to stir up righteous opposition to the president's war.
</P>
<P>
Then she hit on the idea of staking out the road
to Bush's ranch. Brilliant.
</P>
<P>
Reporters who are doomed to follow presidents to their vacation hidey-holes
are a forlorn lot, and the more so when the
spot, like Crawford, Texas, is miles from any restaurant worthy
of the adjective "expense account." The news is usually sparse
to nonexistent and the journalists find themselves turning out for
briefings at which some third assistant press secretary cheerily announces
that the president is enjoying himself and, far from neglecting
business, has congratulated the just-crowned Kansas Corn Queen.
</P>
<P>
So into this bog of sloth and ennui drops Cindy Sheehan.
You can count on it that even the most stridently
secular journalists were thanking God.
</P>
<P>
Even so, the manna was taken up only slowly. For the
first few days, displaying all the vigor that has marked
them during the Bush presidency, the media took only gingerly
notice. But ultimately the Great American News Machine is right
up there with nature in abhorring a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
Feature stories about Sheehan, her son and his service, and about
the branch of the family that doesn't cotton to her
protest, began appearing. They drew a slow accretion of the
like-minded to Sheehan's standard.
</P>
<P>
Sheehan's own small Gold Star Families for Peace was joined by
the women's anti-war outfit, CodePink, and by TrueMajority, the political
arm of Ben and Jerry's ice cream. And Sheehan got
on the horn to the bloggers.
</P>
<P>
With activist free-booters trickling in, before you knew it the media
had a genuine pseudo-event on their hands and since have
been going to
</P>
<P>
town on the story.
</P>
<P>
As you'd expect, this has the political right indignant, as it
is these days at just about everything. Conservatives claim the
whole business has been blown out of proportion by the
ever-plotting liberal media, who are of course out to get
Bush.
</P>
<P>
Public opinion has turned against the war, but the change has
carried no great anti-war excitement. The public has maintained considerable
</P>
<P>
poise, given the provocation of a war disingenuously huckstered, ineptly planned
and increasingly pricey in life, limb and treasure.
</P>
<P>
Bush's wan gesture of sympathy to Sheehan flopped. He has since
hunkered down, and now the motorcades in and out of
the ranch have taken
</P>
<P>
to whizzing past the rankling encampment. A blur is apparently the
next best thing to out of sight, out of mind.
</P>
<P>
Is Bush discomfited? His supporters complain that he is, but so
what? Discomfiture is small enough rebuke, when you consider what
he has
</P>
<P>
gotten us into.
</P>
<P>
Cindy Sheehan isn't going to bring anti-war mobs boiling into the
streets, but if she gives our oft-proclaimed "war president" a
sleepless
</P>
<P>
night or two, it's hard to see how that would be
a bad thing.
