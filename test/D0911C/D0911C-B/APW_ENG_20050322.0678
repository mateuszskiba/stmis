Chess legend Bobby Fischer could leave his Japanese detention cell by the
weekend, his supporters said Tuesday, a day after Iceland's parliament voted to
grant him citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Backers in Iceland, where Fischer played a historic series of matches against
Boris Spassky of the former Soviet Union in 1972, rallied to Fischer's aid after
Japanese immigration authorities detained him last July and ordered him deported
to the United States. Tokyo alleges he was attempting to board a plane for the
Philippines with an invalid U.S. passport.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Iceland's parliament awarded the erratic former chess champion
citizenship with a vote of 40 in favor and two abstaining.
</P>
<P>
Masako Suzuki, one of Fischer's lawyers, said she expected Fischer would be
released within the week. "Unless something very unexpected happens, that would
be the natural course of events," she said.
</P>
<P>
Fischer's Icelandic citizenship still needs a presidential signature for it to
become final, but that was expected Tuesday, Suzuki said.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that there is no need to detain him anymore," she said. "He wants
to leave Japan immediately."
</P>
<P>
Fischer, 62, is fighting a deportation order to the United States, where he is
wanted for violating sanctions imposed on the former Yugoslavia by playing an
exhibition match against Spassky there in 1992. He has instead asked to be sent
to Iceland.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo has so far refused, saying Japanese law only allows for Fischer's
deportation to a country where he is a citizen.
</P>
<P>
Miyoko Watai, his longtime companion and the head of the Japan Chess
Association, said Fischer was "very happy" to hear the news of the Icelandic
parliament vote.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Justice Minister Chieko Nono told reporters that if Fischer has been
granted Icelandic citizenship, it would be "legally possible to deport him to
that country."
</P>
<P>
"We will consider (the possibility) and make an appropriate decision," she said
on TV Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Though a recluse over the past decade, Fischer has emerged from silence in radio
broadcasts and on his Web page to express anti-Semitic views and rail against
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Since being taken into custody, Fischer has said he wants to unilaterally
renounce his U.S. citizenship, demanded political refugee status and announced
that he intends to marry Watai.
</P>
<P>
It wasn't immediately clear if going to Iceland would help Fischer avoid
extradition to the United States if he is charged. The two countries have an
extradition treaty.
</P>
<P>
A federal grand jury in Washington is also investigating possible
money-laundering charges involving Fischer, Richard J. Vattuone, one of his
lawyers, said this month.
</P>
<P>
Fischer was reported to have received US$3.5 million from the Spassky rematch.
He boasted at the time that he didn't intend to pay any income tax on the
winnings.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the State Department declined comment, citing laws governing
rights to privacy in such situations. Fischer has the authority to waive his
privacy rights but has not done do.
