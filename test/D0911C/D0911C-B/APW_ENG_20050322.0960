An Icelandic supporter of Bobby Fischer said Tuesday he had paid a registration
fee that would allow the American chess legend to settle in Iceland.
</P>
<P>
"It costs 20 dollars to register a new Icelandic citizen, and I've happily paid
this for him," Fischer supporter Einar S. Einarsson said.
</P>
<P>
Iceland's parliament voted Monday to give Fischer citizenship as he fights an
order to deport him from Japan to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Einarsson said Fischer's Icelandic passport was expected to be ready Wednesday.
It was not clear whether the passport would be issued in Iceland or through the
country's embassy in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Einarsson said another Icelandic Fischer supporter, Saemundur Palsson, would
arrive in Tokyo on Friday to accompany Fischer to Iceland.
</P>
<P>
Fischer's Japanese lawyer, Masako Suzuki, said she expected him to be released
within the week.
</P>
<P>
"Unless something very unexpected happens, that would be the natural course of
events," she said.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old mercurial chess genius has been in Japanese custody since his
arrest at in July. He is wanted in the United States for violating sanctions
against the former Yugoslavia by playing a chess match there.
</P>
<P>
The legislation to grant Fischer Icelandic citizenship was passed on Monday, and
officially became law with the approval of Iceland's Presidential Authority and
was confirmed in the Parliament Newsletter.
</P>
<P>
Linda Hartley, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Iceland, said the United
States was disappointed Iceland had granted Fischer citizenship.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no official contact between the State Department and the
Icelandic government since Friday, when the State Department sent a message
saying it was disappointed with the foreigner's passport issued to Fischer,"
Hartley said.
</P>
<P>
"Bobby Fischer still remains an American citizen. There is a process that people
can go through to renounce citizenship, but as of today he has not done this,"
Hartley said.
</P>
<P>
Since being taken into custody in Tokyo, Fischer has repeatedly denounced the
U.S. deportation order as politically motivated, demanded refugee status and
renounced his U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
There is widespread support for Fischer in Iceland, where he played the Soviet
Union's Boris Spassky in a world championship match in 1972.
