<P>
The State Department expressed 
disappointment Tuesday over Iceland's move to grant citizenship to 
chess legend Bobby Fischer that could allow him to avoid a US prison 
sentence.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, currently detained in Japan, faces 10 years in prison 
in the United States for playing a 1992 chess match in Yugoslavia in 
defiance of US sanctions imposed over the Balkan wars.
</P>
<P>
But plans to ship him back to his native country became clouded 
after the parliament in Iceland, where he played an epic match in 
1972, voted Monday to grant him citizenship.
</P>
<P>
"It's an arrangement that we're disappointed by," deputy State 
Department spokesman Adam Ereli told reporters. "Mr. Fischer is a 
fugitive from justice. There's a federal warrant for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
"He's being detained in Japan, awaiting deportation. And that's 
the step that we're looking forward to," Ereli said.
</P>
<P>
Japan said Tuesday it may let the 62-year-old Fischer leave for 
Iceland.
