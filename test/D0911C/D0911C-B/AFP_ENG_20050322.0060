Japan said Tuesday it may let detained 
chess legend Bobby Fischer leave for Iceland, which offered the 
maverick genius citizenship to prevent his deportation to the United 
States where he faces prison.
</P>
<P>
"I have received a report that according to the immigration 
control law, it is legally possible to send him there as long as he 
obtains Iceland citizenship," Justice Minister Chieko Noono told 
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I think immigration authorities will consider the case 
appropriately," she said without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, 62, was on Monday made a citizen by the parliament of 
Iceland, where he is famous for a 1972 match. The American dethroned 
Boris Spassky, then a Soviet citizen, in the capital Reykjavik at 
the height of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, known for his eccentric behavior and outspoken 
criticism of his country, played a rematch against Spassky in 1992 
in Yugoslavia in defiance of US sanctions imposed over the Balkan 
wars.
</P>
<P>
He faces 10 years in prison over the chess game if he returns to 
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Fischer has been in detention since July when he tried to fly 
out of Tokyo to the Philippines on his revoked US passport.
</P>
<P>
All 40 members of Iceland's parliament who cast their votes were 
in favor of making Fischer a citizen, while two deputies abstained 
and 21 were absent.
</P>
<P>
"When I briefed Mr. Fischer about the legislation over the phone 
this morning, he told me, 'Oh good,'" Masako Suzuki, the chess 
giant's main lawyer, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"'Anyway, getting the majority is important,'" Fischer was 
quoted by the lawyer as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Now, I am going to ask the Iceland embassy to issue a passport 
as an Icelandic citizen for him," Suzuki said.
</P>
<P>
Fischer had previously looked set to be sent to the United 
States.
</P>
<P>
Iceland had earlier sent Fischer a passport which showed 
residency status but not full nationality, a document not deemed 
sufficient to save him from deportation.
</P>
<P>
Fischer's supporters say the erstwhile American hero has been 
singled out for his political views.
</P>
<P>
Fischer went on Filipino radio on September 11, 2001 to hail the 
"wonderful news" of the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington 
and to launch an anti-Jewish tirade.
</P>
<P>
Iceland's decision rejoiced Fischer's supporters so much that 
they put his name plate on the table at an afternoon press 
conference in Tokyo hoping the chess legend would be able to attend 
it.
</P>
<P>
"Finally we got citizenship for Bobby," his Japanese fiancee 
Miyoko Watai told the news conference after meeting him Tuesday 
morning at the Ushiku immigration lock-up northeast of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Fischer's supporters say he has lost weight and become ragged in 
detention, growing a long beard. He was placed into solitary 
confinement for four days earlier this month in a tussle with guards 
over an egg.
</P>
<P>
"He lost so much weight and he became aged very fast," his 
fiancee said in English. "I think you will be surprised if you see 
him."
</P>
<P>
Watai, who heads the Japan Chess Association, became engaged to 
Fischer after his detention.
</P>
<P>
She said she planned to move with Fischer to Iceland once he is 
released.
</P>
<P>
"We will later consider if our marriage procedures will resume 
in Iceland as the procedures have been suspended," she said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese authorities have not accepted their marriage request, 
as the groom was in custody at the time of application.
