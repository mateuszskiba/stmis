After nearly nine months in a Japanese detention cell, chess legend Bobby
Fischer appeared to have cleared the final hurdle on his way to freedom Tuesday
_ but Japan's government wasn't immediately ceding defeat.
</P>
<P>
In a major breakthrough for Fischer, who is being held for allegedly traveling
on a revoked U.S. passport, Iceland's parliament on Monday granted the former
world champion and notorious eccentric full citizenship, opening the way for him
to leave Japan for that country.
</P>
<P>
Masako Suzuki, one of Fischer's lawyers, said that she expected Fischer to be
released within the week. "Unless something very unexpected happens, that would
be the natural course of events," she said.
</P>
<P>
Iceland is where Fischer won the world championship in 1972, defeating Boris
Spassky of the Soviet Union in a classic Cold War showdown that propelled
Fischer to international stardom.
</P>
<P>
Bolstered by the news, supporters visited Fischer at the immigration detention
center where he remained in custody on the outskirts of Tokyo. Miyoko Watai, his
longtime companion, said Fischer was "very happy" after hearing the
news.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Justice Minister Chieko Nono was quoted on the daily Yomiuri Shimbun's
Web site as saying that if Fischer has been granted Icelandic citizenship, it
would be "legally possible to deport him to that country. We will consider (the
possibility)."
</P>
<P>
Following his arrest in July at Tokyo's Narita airport, Fischer and his team of
lawyers had fought an order that he be deported to the United States, where he
is wanted for violating international sanctions against the former Yugoslavia by
playing a high-profile, and lucrative, exhibition match.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, 62, has since lived up to his reputation as unpredictable _ he has said
he wants to unilaterally renounce his U.S. citizenship, demanded political
refugee status and announced that he intends to marry Watai, who heads Japan's
chess federation.
</P>
<P>
None of the moves swayed Japanese officials, however, who took an increasingly
hard-line position with him.
</P>
<P>
Fischer's fight took a major turn for the better this month, when a delegation
of Icelandic supporters visited him and pushed officials to allow his release.
Iceland's government granted him a special passport, and, when Tokyo indicated
that wasn't enough, on Monday granted him full citizenship.
</P>
<P>
The process still required a formal presidential signature, which was expected
later Tuesday, Suzuki said.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that there is no need to detain him anymore," she said. "He wants
to leave Japan immediately."
</P>
<P>
Fischer became an icon when he dethroned Spassky in a series of games in
Reykjavik to claim America's first world chess championship in more than a
century.
</P>
<P>
But a few years later he refused to defend the title against another Soviet,
Anatoly Karpov. He then fell into obscurity before resurfacing to play an
exhibition rematch against Spassky in the former Yugoslavia in
1992.
</P>
<P>
Fischer won the rematch on the resort island of Sveti Stefan. But the match was
played in violation of U.S. sanctions imposed to punish then-President Slobodan
Milosevic. If convicted, Fischer, who hasn't been to the United States since
then, could face 10 years in prison and a fine of US$250,000
(euro190,000).
</P>
<P>
A federal grand jury in Washington is also investigating possible
money-laundering charges involving Fischer, Richard J. Vattuone, one of his
lawyers, said this month.
</P>
<P>
Fischer was reported to have received US$3.5 million from the Spassky rematch.
He boasted at the time that he didn't intend to pay any income tax on the
winnings.
</P>
<P>
It wasn't immediately clear if going to Iceland would help Fischer avoid
extradition to the United States if he is charged. The two countries have an
extradition treaty.
</P>
<P>
"If the United States wants to charge Bobby with something now, 13 years after
the event, they are welcome to do so," John Bosnitch, head of the Free Bobby
Fischer Committee, told reporters at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Though a recluse over the past decade, Fischer has emerged from silence in radio
broadcasts and on his Web page to express anti-Semitic views and rail against
the United States.
</P>
<P>
His supporters say he is being hounded because of his strongly anti-U.S.
government views.
</P>
<P>
"As he did when he won the world chess championship in 1972, Bobby has shown
that individual freedom will always win," Bosnitch said earlier in a
statement.
