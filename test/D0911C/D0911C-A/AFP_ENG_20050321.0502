Chess legend Bobby Fischer was on 
Monday granted citizenship by the parliament of Iceland, a move 
which could allow him to avoid deportation from Japan to the United 
States where he is wanted for violating sanctions against the former 
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"It is done. The decision is valid from today," Atli Gislason, a 
deputy from the Left-Green movement, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, 62, who is in detention in Japan, faces prison if he 
returns to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The former grandmaster, known for his maverick behavior and 
outspoken criticism of the United States, may face 10 years in 
prison if convicted of violating US sanctions imposed on the former 
Yugoslavia by playing there in 1992.
</P>
<P>
But last week Mizuho Fukushima, head of the Japanese opposition 
Social Democratic Party, told a press conference that Japanese 
immigration officials would not deport Fischer to the United States 
if Iceland grants him nationality.
</P>
<P>
All 40 members of parliament who cast their votes were in favour 
of the motion to grant Fischer citizenship, while two deputies 
abstained, and 21 were absent.
</P>
<P>
Iceland had previously sent Fischer a passport which showed 
residency status but not full nationality, a document not deemed 
sufficient to save him from deportation to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Fischer's link to Iceland dates back to 1972, when he defeated 
Russian Boris Spassky in a world championship match, which ended a 
long domination of the game by Soviet players and was hailed as a 
Cold War victory in his native United States.
</P>
<P>
He was taken into custody in Japan last July for trying to leave 
the country on an invalid US passport.
