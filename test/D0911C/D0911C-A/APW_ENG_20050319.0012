<P>
A parliamentary committee in Iceland voted to grant citizenship to fugitive U.S.
chess star Bobby Fischer, putting the issue up for a vote by all
legislators.
</P>
<P>
"The matter has been finished," Gudrun Oegmundsdottir, a member the General
Committee, said after Friday's vote. "It will now go before the parliament on
Monday for the vote."
</P>
<P>
Fischer, 62, has been detained in Japan awaiting deportation to the United
States, where he is wanted for violating economic sanctions against the former
Yugoslavia by playing a highly publicized chess match there in
1992.
</P>
<P>
One of Fischer's supporters in Iceland said the Japanese government had
confirmed it would allow him to go to Iceland if citizenship was
granted.
</P>
<P>
"This is great news," said Fischer supporter Saemundur Palsson. "They had been
waiting on confirmation from Japan that Fischer would be let go if he had
Icelandic citizenship. This arrived to me this morning."
</P>
<P>
There is widespread support for Fischer in Iceland, where he played the Soviet
Union's Boris Spassky in a world championship match in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Iceland's parliament voted last month against granting Fischer citizenship,
offering him a special foreigners' passport and residence permit instead. But
Japanese officials declined to release him.
</P>
<P>
Since being taken into custody in July for allegedly trying to leave Japan on a
revoked U.S. passport, Fischer has repeatedly denounced the U.S. deportation
order as politically motivated, demanded refugee status, renounced his U.S.
citizenship and said he wants to become a German national instead.
</P>
<P>
He has also applied to marry Mikyoko Watai, head of the Japan Chess
Association.
</P>
<P>
"We are currently organizing a fundraising for the party that will go out to
meet him," said Einar Einarsson, former CEO of VISA Iceland and one of Fischers
strongest supporters.
</P>
<P>
"We might need to bring his girlfriend Miyoko Watai over too, as well as John
Bosnitch, his supporter now in Japan, so there are expenses involved," Einarsson
said. "Fischer has money, but he can't get at it from where he is
now."
