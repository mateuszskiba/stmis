A parliamentary committee voted Friday to grant citizenship to fugitive U.S.
chess star Bobby Fischer, putting the issue up for a vote by all
legislators.

<P>
"The matter has been finished," said Gudrun Oegmundsdpttir, a member the General
Committee. "It will now go before the parliament on Monday for the
vote."

Fischer, 62, has been detained in Japan awaiting deportation to the United
States, where he is wanted for violating economic sanctions against the former
Yugoslavia by playing a highly publicized chess match there in
1992.
</P>
<P>
There is widespread support for Fischer in Iceland, where he played the Soviet
Union's Boris Spassky in a world championship match in 1972.

<P>
Iceland's parliament voted last month against granting Fischer citizenship,
offering him a special foreigners' passport and residence permit instead. But
Japanese officials have so far declined to release Fischer.
</P>
<P>
Several Icelandic politicians indicated this week that parliament was now likely
to grant Fischer citizenship.
