Chess legend Bobby Fischer, who faces 
prison if he returns to the United States, can only avoid 
deportation from Japan if Iceland upgrades its granting of residency 
to full citizenship, a Japanese lawmaker said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mizuho Fukushima, head of the opposition Social Democratic 
Party, told a press conference that Japanese immigration officials 
are opting to deport Fischer to the United States unless Iceland 
grants him nationality.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, 62, known for his maverick behavior and outspoken 
criticism of his country, may face 10 years in prison if convicted 
of violating US sanctions imposed on the former Yugoslavia by 
playing there in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Fukushima met Masaharu Miura, chief of the justice ministry's 
immigration bureau, who had told parliament Tuesday that the chess 
genius could only be deported to his country of origin -- the United 
States.
</P>
<P>
The socialist leader said of the prospect of Fischer going to 
Iceland: "Mr Miura told us that it would be okay if Iceland gives 
him citizenship.
</P>
<P>
"The Social Democratic Party will bring up the issue at the 
parliament and will work to let the Japanese public know about the 
case," she said.
</P>
<P>
Iceland has offered residency to Fischer, who is famous in 
Reykjavik for dethroning the Soviet Boris Spassky there in 1972 at 
the height of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Iceland has sent him a passport which shows residency status but 
it has not offered him nationality.
</P>
<P>
Socialist leader Fukushima, who is also a well-known human 
rights lawyer, is scheduled to meet the Icelandic ambassador on 
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Fischer's supporters accuse the United States of piling pressure 
both on Japan and Iceland so it can get ahold of the chess legend.
</P>
<P>
The supporters say Fischer would not receive a fair trial in the 
United States due to his controversial past statements, such as 
hailing the September 11, 2001 attacks as "wonderful news" and 
anti-Jewish remarks.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Fischer would be free if he were not Mr Fischer," said 
Masako Suzuki, his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
But even if Iceland offered Fischer citizenship, his case would 
still be in legal limbo because of his US nationality.
</P>
<P>
An immigration official at the justice ministry said that a 
person with two nationalities is usually deported to the country 
whose passport he or she used to enter Japan. That would mean the 
United States for Fischer.
</P>
<P>
Fischer has been held since July when he attempted to fly out of 
Japan on an allegedly invalid US passport, but from detention he has 
been unable to renounce his US citizenship.
</P>
<P>
A renunciation would make him a man without a country. He has 
sought political asylum in Japan and applied for a German passport 
on account of his German father, but neither route has been 
successful.
</P>
<P>
Fukushima said justice ministry officials told her that they had 
not discussed Fischer's case with their US nor Icelandic 
counterparts, after opposition allegations that Japan was caving in 
to US pressure.
</P>
<P>
Fischer is little known in Japan. The media has largely ignored 
his plight even though in detention he became engaged to the head of 
the Japan Chess Association.
