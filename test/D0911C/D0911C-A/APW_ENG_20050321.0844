Iceland's parliament voted Monday to grant citizenship to fugitive U.S. chess
star Bobby Fischer.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, passed with 40 lawmakers voting "aye" and two abstaining
following a brief debate, became law immediately.
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased with this, and I think that the dignity of the parliament has
increased," Fischer's supporter Saemundur Palsson said.
</P>
<P>
He said Fischer, 62, would be informed of the vote Tuesday morning in Japan,
where he has been detained awaiting deportation to the United States on a
warrant for violating economic sanctions against the former Yugoslavia by
playing a chess match there in 1992.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that he will stop cursing the Americans now. It has gotten him into so
much trouble," Palsson said.
</P>
<P>
Einar S. Einarsson, another of Fischer's key supporters, said he spoke to the
mercurial chess genius earlier Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fischer hoped the vote process would be quick, Einarsson said, and "I don't
think it could have been much quicker." The bill went through the required three
readings in 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Office of Immigration said a passport for Fischer could be
ready as early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There is widespread support for Fischer in Iceland, where he played the Soviet
Union's Boris Spassky in a world championship match in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Iceland's parliament voted last month against granting Fischer citizenship,
offering him a special foreigners' passport and residence permit instead. But
Japanese officials declined to release him.
</P>
<P>
Since being taken into custody in July for allegedly trying to leave Japan on a
revoked U.S. passport, Fischer has repeatedly denounced the U.S. deportation
order as politically motivated, demanded refugee status, renounced his U.S.
citizenship and said he wants to become a German national.
</P>
<P>
He has also applied to marry Mikyoko Watai, head of the Japan Chess
Association.
