The French government is understood to be ready to repatriate the
body of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to Palestine if he dies.

While declining to give any information on Arafat's health, when
pressed on the country's involvement in Arafat's funeral
arrangements, a French government spokesman indicated France's
readiness to repatriate the body.

"It is the medical authorities, in agreement with Arafat's family, to
announce on Yasser Arafat's health," the spokesman told a news
conference. "For the rest, we are preparing all the necessary
measures along with the family and the Palestinian Authority."

Palestinian representative in Paris, Leila Shahid, said Wednesday
morning that Arafat was still alive but in a "very critical"
condition.

Palestinian Islamic cleric Tayssir el-Tamimi announced Monday outside
the Percy military hospital that Arafat was still alive and that
disconnecting his life support system is out of the question.

However, a Palestinian official source said Arafat's death will be
officially announced on Wednesday at Arafat's headquarters at al
Muqata'a in the West Bank city of Ramallah.

The Palestinian National Authority agreed at a meeting on Wednesday
to hold Arafat's funeral in Cairo in case of his death.

A Palestinian senior cabinet official announced Wednesday that a
series of meetings had been held since Tuesday night and to discuss
repatriation of Arafat's body if he dies.

Minister of state in the cabinet Qadoura Fares said that "if Arafat
dies, the body of the president would be brought to Cairo where Arab
and international leaders and presidents could greet his body for the
last time."
</P>
<P>
After Cairo, the body will be taken to al Muqata'a where all
arrangements for the burial, mourning and condolences would take
place, said Fares.
