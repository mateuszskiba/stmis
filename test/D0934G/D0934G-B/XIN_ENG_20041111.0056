Israel sealed off West Bank and Gaza Strip, sent reinforcements to
the two areas and tightened security at Jewish settlements Thursday
just hours after Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's death.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli Defense Forces are deploying to allow a dignified
funeral ceremony for Chairman Arafat," said Israeli military radio.
</P>
<P>
According to the blanket close-off plan, only Palestinians with
necessary permits will be allowed to attend Arafat's burial scheduled
for Saturday in Ramallah, a West Bank city Arafat's headquarters was
located, said Israeli military officials.
</P>
<P>
Such restriction meant no Palestinians will be able to enter Israel
unless they have special permits from Israel.
</P>
<P>
The 75-year-old Arafat died at a French military hospital at 3: 30 am
local time (0230GMT) on Thursday. The body of Arafat will be flown to
Cairo, capital of Egypt, for a funeral scheduled for Friday. After
the memorial service, Arafat's body would be flown to Ramallah.
