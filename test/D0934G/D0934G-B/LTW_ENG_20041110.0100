The fleet of trucks, bulldozers and backhoes
lumbered into place here Wednesday afternoon, and aimed for a small
grove of cypress trees, shoving aside the rusted remains of junked
cars along the way.
</P>
<P>
By dusk, most of the debris was cleared away. The cypress trees
still stood, on the edge of a concrete parking lot, in the shadow of
the ruined presidential compound of Yasser Arafat. Sullen-faced
members of the presidential guard sat slumped on a wall and watched.
</P>
<P>
The workers were clearing space, in the sparse shade of the cypress
trees, for Arafat's grave.
</P>
<P>
Believing Arafat's death in a French hospital to be imminent,
officials spent Wednesday finalizing plans for his funeral and burial.
A memorial service will be held in Cairo, Egypt, they announced,
followed by burial at the presidential compound, where Arafat lived in
difficult conditions for most of the past three years.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian foreign minister, Nabil Shaath, said Arafat had
suffered liver and kidney failure, and that there continued to be
bleeding from. Arafat remained in a deep coma and connected to a
respirator and a feeding tube.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin said that Arafat was in
his ``final hours,'' telling French television: ``I hope that we can
respect the final hours of a man who is approaching death.''
</P>
<P>
A senior Muslim cleric, Taissir Dayut Tamimi, arrived in Paris on
Wednesday to be with the Palestinian leader, who was at the Percy
Military Training Hospital, connected to a respirator and a feeding
tube.
</P>
<P>
``I prayed to God for his recovery,'' said Tamimi, who said he was
with Arafat for more than an hour, reciting from the Muslim holy book.
Tamimi said life-support machines would not be turned off ``as long as
there are signs of life in the body of the president.''
</P>
<P>
But by midmorning Wednesday, Palestinian radio and television
stations began playing recitations from the Quran. Posters of Arafat
started to appear on windows, doors and the hoods of cars. Shopkeepers
closed early anticipating an announcement.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the three dominant political organizations --
the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Palestinian Authority and
Arafat's Fatah party -- met jointly to approve a succession plan that
divides powers among the three institutions. It was agreed that the
speaker of parliament, Rawhi Fattouh, would succeed Arafat as
president of the Palestinian Authority until elections could be held,
by law within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
Fattouh, 55, is from Rafah in the Gaza Strip and regarded as an
Arafat loyalist. But during a parliament session in August, the last
Arafat attended, Fattouh pledged to carry out reforms if Arafat stood
in the way.
</P>
<P>
The PLO, also headed by Arafat, plans to hold elections for a new
chairman after Arafat's death, but officials said that the PLO's
second-in-command, Mahmoud Abbas, would probably to chosen.
</P>
<P>
``The discussions were complex and difficult,'' said Qadura Faris,
a senior member of Fatah. ``But everything will go well in the end and
will go according to our laws.''
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's somber remarks by Palestinian officials were in marked
contrast to earlier this week, when officials considered discussing a
funeral inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
Hamad Batrawi, 77, a long-time clerk in the Palestinian Authority's
Cultural Ministry, lives across a narrow street from the front gates
of Arafat's compound. A decade ago, Batrawi stood on his roof and
watched Arafat arrive by helicopter, as Israel turned the city over to
Palestinian self-rule.
</P>
<P>
Last month, he watched another helicopter take Arafat away to
France. He said he would be back on his roof again when Arafat returns
a final time. Batrawi said, ``It won't be the same without him.''
