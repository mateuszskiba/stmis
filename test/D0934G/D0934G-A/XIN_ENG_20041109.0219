Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat would be buried at his headquarters
in the West Bank town of Ramallah, well-informed Palestinian sources
said Tuesday.

The sources told the Dubai-based al-Arabiya TV that France reached a
compromise with Israel to bury Arafat in Ramallah after his death.

Palestinian officials refused to comment on the report, saying it was
still too early to talk about the burial place as long as Arafat was
still alive.

Tuesday witnessed a flurry of conflicting reports on Arafat's fate,
with some claiming he was dead and others saying his vital organs
were still functioning.

Israel opposes burying Arafat in Jerusalem, although Arafat himself
indicated preference for the city for his final resting place.

Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said earlier that Arafat could be
buried in Gaza and Israel has completed preparations for the burial.
