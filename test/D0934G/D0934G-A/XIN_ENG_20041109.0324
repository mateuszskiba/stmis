Egypt might host a funeral service for Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat in the event of his death, Palestinian delegate to the Arab
League (AL) Ahmed Sobeih told Xinhua late Tuesday.

<P>
Meanwhile, the Al-Arabiya TV channel reported Tuesday night that the
Palestinian side will announce the death of 75-year-old veteran
leader Yasser Arafat Wednesday morning.

<P>
"Palestinian officials will make an announcement about the passing
away of President Arafat Wednesday morning," the TV report said,
quoting sources in France, where Arafat had been treated since Oct.
29.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Arabic-language news network said that Arafat
had died at a French military hospital.
</P>
<P>
As Arafat had struggled for life, there has been wild guess as to
where he might be buried and where to hold the funeral service.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is reportedly to have offered to hold a funeral service for
Arafat, partly to spare Arab leaders from Israeli security measures
they have to go through if they go to the Palestinian territories to
pay their last respect to the Palestinian leader.
