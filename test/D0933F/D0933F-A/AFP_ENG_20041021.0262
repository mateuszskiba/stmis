Children of older fathers face an enhanced risk of developing
schizophrenia when they grow older, according to research published
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in Sweden and Britain spotted the statistical risk after
sifting through the medical records of 712,000 people born in Sweden
between 1973 and 1980.
</P>
<P>
They identified 639 people who had been hospitalised with
schizophrenia at some point between 1989 and 2001. Only four of these
were siblings.
</P>
<P>
After taking into account the patients' socioeconomic background,
family history of psychosis, early parental death and other factors
that could affect the outcome, the researchers found a strong
statistical link between schizophrenics and the age of their father.
</P>
<P>
More than 15 percent of cases may have been due to the fact that the
patient had a father who was aged over 30 years at birth, they
believe.
</P>
<P>
The risk of schizophrenia was statistically small but rose steadily
the greater the age of the father at birth.
</P>
<P>
The authors say this statistical evidence adds to previous research
that points to an inherited source for schizophrenia and that
mutations in sperm, which accumulate as a man gets older, contribute
to the risk.
</P>
<P>
Schizophrenia is a severe disease of the brain, characterised by
hallucinations and delusions that give a distorted view of reality.
It is not, as is popularly thought, a Jekyll-and-Hyde condition of
split personality.
</P>
<P>
The study is published by BMJ Online First, of the British Medical
Journal (BMJ). Its lead author is Finn Rasmussen, an associate
professor of epidemiology at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
The doctors say that their findings are important, given the trend in
developed countries towards delaying parenthood.
</P>
<P>
In the case of England and Wales, they note that the average age of
fathers at the birth of their child was 29.2 years in 1980. In 2002,
this had risen to 32.1 years.
</P>
<P>
If the model is correct, this increase in paternal age could have led
to an additional 720 cases of schizophrenia in 2002.
