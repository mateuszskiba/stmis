KAMPALA, May 6 (Xinhua)

<P>
About 1.47 million Ugandans are 
suffering from sever mental illness, local media said on Friday 
quoting a report dubbed "Progress Report 2004-2005."
</P>
<P>
This figure also accounts for the two percent of the population
that suffers from epilepsy, one percent suffer from schizophrenia 
and three percent maniac depression, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has a population of 26.8 million, according to the 2002 
national population census.
</P>
<P>
The report quotes World Health Organization statistics showing 
that mental illness accounts for about 12.3 percent of the global 
disease burden.
</P>
<P>
"This will rise to 15 percent by the year 2020 by which time, 
depression will disable more than AIDS heart disorders, traffic 
accidents and wars combined. The impact, both social and economic,
on the lives of mentally ill people, their families and 
communities is phenomenal," said the report which was carried out 
by an international non-governmental organization, Basic needs UK 
in Uganda (BUU).
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Margaret Mungerera, a senior psychiatrist at 
Butabika National Psychiatrist Hospital, the number of people with
mental disorders is likely to be high because the BUU study did 
not cover the whole country
</P>
<P>
The study covered the districts of Kampala, Masaka, Hoima 
Sembabule and Masindi. Uganda has a total of 56 districts.
</P>
<P>
"Basing on what we see, the country might even be having a 
bigger number of psychiatric victims. Take example of poverty 
gibbering among the people, the northern Uganda war and the 
changed lifestyle, all these can cause mental disorders," said Dr.
Mungerera.
</P>
<P>
At least 115 mentally ill people in Kampala and Sembabule were 
cured of mental disorders and discharged during the study.
</P>
<P>
The BUU study was started in 2002 to determine whether Uganda 
would be eligible to initiate a mental health and development 
program.
