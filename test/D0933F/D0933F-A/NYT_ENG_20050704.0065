EXPLAINING DIFFERENCES IN TWINS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Identical twins possess exactly the same set of genes. Yet as
they grow older, they may begin to display subtle differences.
</P>
<P>
They may start to look different, develop different diseases or slide
into different personalities. Women who are identical twins may differ
in their fertility or in the age at which they
reach menopause.
</P>
<P>
These discrepancies are usually attributed to ill-defined differences in environment.
</P>
<P>
But a whole new level of explanation has been opened up
by a genetic survey showing that identical twins, as they
grow older, differ increasingly in what is known as their
epigenome. The term refers to natural chemical modifications that occur
in a person's genome shortly after conception and that act
on a gene like a gas pedal or a brake,
marking it for higher or lower activity.
</P>
<P>
Identical twins have the same set of epigenetic marks on the
genome when they are born. But differences in the epigenome
emerge as the twins grow older and become greater the
longer they live apart, say a team of researchers led
by Dr. Manel Esteller of the Spanish National Cancer Center
in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Their report appears in Tuesday's issue of The Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most fascinating things I have read,"
said Dr. Nancy Segal, a psychologist who studies twins at
California State University at Fullerton and the author of "Indivisible
by Two," a forthcoming book on twins. "By giving us
a handle on something specific it opens up many new
avenues of inquiry as to why twins are different."
</P>
<P>
There are two possible explanations for Esteller's findings. One is simply
the well- known fact that epigenetic marks are lost as
people get older. Because the marks are removed randomly, they
would be expected to occur differently in two members of
a twin pair.
</P>
<P>
A second possible explanation is that personal experiences and elements in
the environment -- including toxic agents like tobacco smoke --
feed back onto the genome by changing the pattern of
epigenetic marks.
</P>
<P>
Esteller believes he is seeing both processes at work. The evidence
for the second process, he said, is that twins who
reported that they had lived apart the longest also had
the greatest differences in their epigenome.
</P>
<P>
"This is a way for the genome to be responsive to
the environment," he said, noting that it is easier for
chemical marks on the genome to change than for the
genome itself to mutate.
</P>
<P>
His study suggests that the epigenome may be involved in many
diseases that can affect identical twins differently, like schizophrenia, bipolar
disorder and cancer. Although schizophrenia evidently has a genetic component,
the epigenome may hold the clue to its nongenetic aspects.
</P>
<P>
Differences between identical twins could also help pinpoint the epigenetic differences
that contribute to cancer. "We think that epigenetic changes are
very common in cancer," said Dr. Peter A. Jones, president
of the American Association for Cancer Research and a professor
at the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
Jones said Esteller's finding "is exceptionally interesting in that it underlines
the importance of epigenetic changes in human development and disease."
</P>
<P>
Jones recently convened a workshop to discuss starting an international human
epigenome project. The proposal could rival the Human Genome Project
in complexity because the human genome is the same in
every cell of a person's body, while the epigenome is
expected to be different for each of the 250 or
so human cell types.
</P>
<P>
Among the most important components of the epigenome are small chemical
handles known as methyl groups, which are added directly to
the chemical units of DNA.
</P>
<P>
A wave of demethylation occurs in a sperm's genome shortly after
an egg is fertilized, followed by the extensive readdition of
methyl groups in early embryonic development.
</P>
<P>
These methyl groups, which generally inhibit the activity of the genes
in which they occur, tend to be lost during aging.
Esteller's team studied the total amount of methylation in the
twins' genomes, as well as another kind of epigenetic modification,
the addition of acetyl groups to the histone proteins that
act as a scaffolding and as a control system for
DNA.
