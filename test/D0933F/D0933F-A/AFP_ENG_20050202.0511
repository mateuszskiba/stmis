<P>
Alarmed by the rising consumption of 
cannabis among French teenagers, the government on Wednesday 
launched a 10-million euro (13 million dollar) campaign to warn of 
the drug's harmful effects on physical and mental health.
</P>
<P>
With more than one in five 18 year-old boys claiming to be 
regular users -- and more than half of all 17 year-olds having 
smoked cannabis at least once -- France has the highest consumption 
rate in Europe along with Britain and the Czech Republic, according 
to official figures.
</P>
<P>
The media campaign -- including a series of radio and television 
advertisements and the distribution of hundreds of thousands of 
leaflets -- is to "set the myth of cannabis against the reality in 
order to debunk notions about its alleged harmlessness," the 
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 250 consultation centres are also to be established 
across the country, and a telephone hotline set up to advise those 
tempted by the drug. From the start of the next academic year, the 
campaign will be extended inside secondary schools. 
</P>
<P>
According to the French Observatory on Drugs and Addiction 
(OFDT), there are 850,000 regular consumers of cannabis in the 
country -- of whom 450,000 smoke cannabis every day. The number of 
17 year-olds who have experimented with it has doubled in ten years, 
the OFDT calcalates.
</P>
<P>
Toxicologists have established that the cannabis widely consumed 
today is far stronger than the drug that became current in 
university campuses in the 1960s and 70s, and warn that the 
psychological damage is greatly underestimated.
</P>
<P>
Among the harmful effects to be highlighted in the campaign are 
memory loss, concentration lapses, altered perception and alienation 
from friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a syndrome of demotivation which results in a lack of 
interest in school work and a gradual desocialisation. At the same 
time we now have proof of the link between cannabis abuse and 
certain acute or chronic psychotic conditions," said Dr Michel 
Reynaud, author of Cannabis and Health.
</P>
<P>
Recent studies have established that cannabis can be a 
contributory cause in triggering schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
Concern over cannabis use has grown in recent years after a 
series of fatal road accidents in which it was shown that the drug 
was a cause. In 2003 a law was passed that makes driving under the 
influence of cannabis a criminal offence, and urine tests are being 
extended.
</P>
<P>
"Cannabis has been shown to be responsible for 20 percent of 
accidents caused by people under 30 years of age," said Patrick 
Mura, president of the French Society for Analytical Toxicology.
</P>
<P>
The government is also alarmed by the power of the drug economy 
in the country's high-immigration city suburbs, to where much the 
cannabis is initially smuggled from Morocco.
