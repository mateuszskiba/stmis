Dr. Frederic Quitkin, a psychiatrist whose research helped establish that certain
kinds of depression could best be treated with medications and
that schizophrenia was related to neurological impairments rather than problems
of childhood, died on Oct. 9 in New York. He
was 68.
</P>
<P>
The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his son, Dr. Matt Quitkin
of Washington.

<P>
Quitkin, a Manhattan resident, was the founding director of the Depression
Evaluation Service at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and
a professor of clinical psychiatry at the Columbia University College
of Physicians and Surgeons.

"He developed the concept of an atypical depression that is quite
chronic, where people tend to overeat and oversleep and respond
very specifically to a group of medications that aren't used
that much," said Dr. Donald Klein, director of research at
the New York State Psychiatric Institute and a colleague at
Columbia.

Many people with depression respond to selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, like
Prozac and Zoloft, or a class of drugs known as
tricyclics. Quitkin's research helped establish that atypical depression could be
more effectively treated with a class of drugs known as
MAO inhibitors, Klein said.

<P>
In addition to his work on atypical depression and schizophrenia, Quitkin
researched other psychiatric disorders, including those associated with drug and
alcohol dependence, and on treatment with a placebo.
</P>
<P>
Frederic Quitkin was born in New York City. He received his
undergraduate degree from Princeton and his medical degree and a
doctorate of medical science from the State University of New
York Downstate Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
In addition to his son, he is survived by two daughters,
Megan and Rachel, both of New York; and two grandsons.
