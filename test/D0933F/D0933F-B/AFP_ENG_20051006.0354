How well you sleep could depend on who 
your parents were, researchers at Switzerland's Lausanne University 
reported on Thursday after identifying for the first time a "normal 
sleep" gene among mice.
</P>
<P>
"The first lesson of our research is that the quality of sleep 
is genetically determined," Mehdi Tafti, a professor at the 
university's Centre for Integrative Genomics, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The scientists used an electroencephalograph to study 
low-frequency brain waves among mice.
</P>
<P>
These so-called delta waves, the result of neuron activity, are 
telltales of the depth and quality of sleep.
</P>
<P>
"We realised that some mice slept less well because they lacked 
delta activity," Tafti said.  "When we compared their genes with 
those of other mice, we localised the gene responsible for this 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
The finger points at a gene that encodes cell receptor for 
retinoic acid.
</P>
<P>
Vitamin A, found in eggs, carrots and other orange or yellow 
vegetables, is known to act on this receptor.
</P>
<P>
Scientists already knew that vitamin A plays an important role 
in the brain, in respect of sight but also diseases such as 
schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's -- diseases that are also 
accompanied by a lack of delta activity.
</P>
<P>
Research on the mice found too much vitamin A was bad for sleep, 
although the scientists are unsure what the results of a deficiency 
of the vitamin would be and what the ideal intake is. Too much 
vitamin A can damage health, especially among pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
In humans, delta activity diminishes with age, which is why 
children sleep deeply and awake refreshed, while old people usually 
sleep less well.
</P>
<P>
The study appears on Friday in the US weekly journal Science.
</P>
<P>
Previous research has identified genes that can cause 
sleeplessness, but this is the first to identify a gene linked with 
normal sleep.
