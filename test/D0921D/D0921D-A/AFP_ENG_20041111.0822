Michael Jackson's feud with Eminem spilled on to the streets of New
York on Thursday as the self-styled King of Pop's fans listened to
their hero slam the rapper during a protest over a music video
depicting a Jackson look-alike in a bed with children.

<P>
About 20 Jackson fans stood before MTV's studios in Times Square as
Jackson blasted Eminem and his video.

"It's demeaning and disrespectful," Jackson told Fox News in a live
telephone call heard by his fans through speakers. He told his fans:
"I love them so much."
</P>
<P>
"And I also want to make it clear that it's not just about Michael
Jackson but about a pattern of disrespect that he has shown to our
community," Jackson said of the white rapper. "He needs to stop it,
and he needs to stop it now."
</P>
<P>
Black Entertainment Television (BET) agreed to stop broadcasting the
video, but MTV has balked at Jackson's request.

Jackson, 46, who is awaiting trial on child molestation charges,
wants the rapper's "Just Lose It" video, which shows a Jackson
look-alike on a bed surrounded by children, taken off the air.

<P>
In the irreverent song, the always controversial Eminem says: "Come
here little kiddie, on my lap. Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean rap, as in a case of child molestation."
