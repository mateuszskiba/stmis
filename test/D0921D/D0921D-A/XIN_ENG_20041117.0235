<P>
A former business associate of US pop singer Michael Jackson has
filed a lawsuit against the entertainer for breaching contract, local
media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by Marc Schaffel,
who is seeking 3 million US dollars for unpaid loans, cash advances
and producing fees.
</P>
<P>
Schaffel claims that he helped Jackson make a pair of Fox television
specials to rebut a controversial TV documentary that took a critical
look at the singer's eccentric lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
It was that documentary, aired on ABC and British television in
February 2003, that led to public fury about Jackson's dubious
relationship with children and sparked calls for an investigation
against Jackson.
</P>
<P>
In the documentary, Jackson appeared on camera holding hands with a
12-year-old boy with whom the singer admitted sharing his bedroom.
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara County prosecutors conducted search of Jackson's
Neverland ranch in the county and charged Jackson with molesting the
boy shown in the documentary after a doctor tipped the police.
</P>
<P>
Jackson, freed on a 3-million-dollar bail, is scheduled to stand
trial on Jan. 31 on a 10-count indictment that charges him with child
molestation and conspiracy to kidnap.
