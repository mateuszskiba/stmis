An antiques and furniture store has sued pop star Michael Jackson for
allegedly failing to pay a nearly US$180,000 (euro138,000) bill.

<P>
Kamad Enterprise, which owns Mayfair Gallery, claimed Jackson owes
US$178,875 (euro137,340) of the US$378,875 (euro290,905) in
merchandise he allegedly purchased in May, according to a complaint
filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court.

Mayfair Gallery sells mostly 19th-century European furniture.

Jackson bought 20 items, including a malachite urn, a Louis XVI-style
bust clock, silver bread holder and an "Austrian gold-painted dancing
girl," the complaint said.

An attorney for Jackson, Brian Oxman, said he had not reviewed the
complaint. "Like other proceedings involving Michael Jackson, we'll
look at it carefully and deal with it in a professional manner,"
Oxman said.

<P>
It was the second legal action against Jackson this week alleging he
failed to pay bills. J. Marc Schaffel, a former producer and business
associate, sued the singer Tuesday, claiming Jackson owes him more
than US$3 million (euro2.3 million) in loans and producing fees.

Jackson is also facing child molestation charges and has pleaded not
guilty. His trial is scheduled for Jan. 31.
