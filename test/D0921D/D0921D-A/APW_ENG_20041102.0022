California attorney general supports prosecutor in Jackson child
molestation case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California's attorney general has urged the judge in the Michael
Jackson child molestation case to reject a bid by the pop star to
remove the Santa Barbara County prosecutor's office from the case.
</P>
<P>
State Attorney General Bill Lockyer called the request "baseless" and
said it was premised on "conjecture and unfounded speculation."
</P>
<P>
Jackson's lawyers allege that District Attorney Tom Sneddon is
"blinded by his zeal to convict Michael Jackson," creating a conflict
of interest that would prevent Jackson from receiving a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
Jackson has pleaded not guilty to child molestation, conspiracy and
administering an intoxicating agent, alcohol. Trial is set for Jan.
31.
</P>
<P>
In a motion filed Thursday, Lockyer responded that Jackson's lawyers
failed to show the district attorney's "zeal" in prosecuting the
charges stemmed from anything but an "impartial consideration of the
case."
</P>
<P>
As with the majority of documents in the case, Lockyer's full motion
was sealed but an edited version was posted on the court's Web site.
</P>
<P>
Jackson's attorney Steve Cochran, in a motion filed Oct. 8, accused
Sneddon of having a vendetta against Jackson dating back to a 1993
molestation investigation that never resulted in charges being filed.
</P>
<P>
Jackson's attorneys were particularly concerned about what they
decried as Sneddon's "smug" and "jocular" manner during a news
conference in which he announced Jackson's arrest.
</P>
<P>
Lockyer wrote that even if Sneddon had personal animosity toward
Jackson, that would not be enough to show a conflict of interest or
warrant his removal.
</P>
<P>
"In sum, all of the defendant's baseless allegations are based on
surmise, conjecture and unfounded speculation," Lockyer wrote.
