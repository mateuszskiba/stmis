Investigators took DNA from pop star Michael Jackson's mouth
Saturday, a day after raiding his Neverland Ranch to prepare for his
trial on child molestation charges, a family source said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The DNA swab was done on Saturday in Michael's house at the ranch,"
the source said. "Attorney Tom Mesereau was with Michael when they
did it."
</P>
<P>
Jackson and his three children -- aged 7, 6 and 2 -- were all at the
ranch when dozens of sheriff's deputies armed with two search
warrants arrived early Friday, the source said.
</P>
<P>
"Michael's children were traumatized. They were terrified. They
cried," the source said.
</P>
<P>
Mesereau rushed from Los Angeles via helicopter to help his client
and arranged for Jackson and his children to leave until the raid was
over.
</P>
<P>
"The cops were there all day, until 5:15 pm. Tom agreed to bring
Michael back on Saturday to provide the DNA," the source added.
</P>
<P>
Jackson fans close to the family said the pop star and his children
spent Friday in the gambling getaway of Las Vegas in neighboring
Nevada state.
</P>
<P>
Jackson, 46, is charged with having molested a 12-year-old cancer
survivor at Neverland in February and March 2003. He has pleaded
innocent and is free on three million dollars bail.
</P>
<P>
Jury selection for his trial is due to begin in Santa Maria on
January 31.
</P>
<P>
Police Friday spent eight hours combing Jackson's ranch, which lies
about 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of Los Angeles, Chris Pappas
of the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department confirmed.
</P>
<P>
He refused to comment further on the surprise search of Neverland
that came as lawyers prepare to take the case to trial.
</P>
<P>
Jackson's legal team has accused prosecutor Tom Sneddon of waging a
vendetta against the pop icon, despite a lack of evidence in the
case.
</P>
<P>
His lawyers have complained that investigations and searches are
still being carried out more than a year after Jackson was arrested
and charged, delaying progress in the case.
