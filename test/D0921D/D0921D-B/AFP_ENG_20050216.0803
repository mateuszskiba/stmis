Michael Jackson is in 
stable condition but needs further care for "persistent viral 
symptoms," a doctor treating the pop star at a California hospital 
said Wednesday.
</P>

"Mr Jackson continues to be in stable condition and remains 
under observation at this time," Todd Bailey told journalists 
outside the Marian Medical Center in Santa Maria.

"He continues to need care for some persistent viral symptoms, 
but otherwise, he is in good spirits," Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
The doctor declined to comment further on Jackson's health and 
would not say how much longer the pop legend would remain 
hospitalized.

Jackson was rushed to the hospital on Tuesday after he vomited 
in his car as he was being driven to the Santa Maria court, where he 
is on trial on charges of sexually molesting a 13-year-old boy.
