A British television 
documenatry that led to a child sex investigation against Michael 
Jackson "rocked" the cash-strapped entertainer's world, prosecutor 
Tom Sneedon alleged Monday.

"The defendant Michael Jackson's world was rocked," Sneddon told 
the jury in opening arguments of the long awaited celebrity trial in 
the California town of Santa Maria.

"It wasn't rocked in the musical sense it was rocked in the real 
life sense," he said of the growing public and media outcry 
following the February 2003 broadcast of journalist Martin Bashir's 
documentary "Living With Michael Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
"His life was rocked so badly, his close friend and confidant 
Marc Schaffel called it a train wreck," Sneddon said.
</P>
<P>
Sneddon alleged that for years the 1980s pop icon Jackson had 
been in tremendous financial debt, which led him and his aides to 
hatch a plot to kidnap the boy and his family and hold them against 
their will in order to limit the damage caused by the film.
