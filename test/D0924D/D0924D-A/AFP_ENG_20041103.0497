Merck's Vioxx may have led to 27,785 heart attacks: FDA study
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON, Nov 3 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A study sponsored by the US Food and Drug Administration estimates
that Merck painkiller Vioxx, withdrawn from the market in September,
could have caused 27,785 heart attacks or deaths since it was
approved in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The study concluded that Vioxx, known under the chemical name
rofecoxib, "increases the risk of serious coronary heart disease
defined as acute myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death," the
FDA study concluded.
</P>
<P>
A high dose increased risk by 3.7-fold and standard-dose by 1.5-fold
compared to a rival drug produced by Pfizer, Celebrex, or celecoxib,
the FDA said.
</P>
<P>
The study, published Tuesday, also suggested Merck tried to explain
away signs that showed Vioxx increased the risk of heart attacks, in
company-sponsored clinical trials four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Merck had argued that a comparison between Vioxx and a generic
anti-inflammatory drug called naproxen was misleading because the
latter could help protect against heart attacks or strokes.
</P>
<P>
However, the FDA study disputed that, saying naproxen showed "no
protective effect" against heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
"The manufacturer attributed this difference to a never-before
recognized protective effect of Naproxen," said the study.
</P>
<P>
"To explain a five-fold difference, Naproxen would have had to be one
of the most potent and effective cardio-protectants known."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday the company described the FDA estimates as speculation:
"In general, there is no reliable way to measure the actual use in
the population and therefore no reliable way to estimate the actual
number of events."
</P>
<P>
Merck pulled the 2.5 billion dollar-a-year-seller Vioxx off the
market on September 30 when an internal study found it doubled the
risk of heart attack and stroke after 18 months of continuous use.
