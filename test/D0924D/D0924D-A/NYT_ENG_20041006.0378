<P>
With Vioxx coming off the pharmacy shelves, what is a patient who
took that drug for pain supposed to do?
</P>
<P>
Call the doctor who prescribed it and talk about alternatives.
</P>
<P>
But while patients need to stop taking Vioxx, local physicians said,
it is not always easy to decide on a new course of treatment.
</P>
<P>
"There's not a simple generic answer," said Dr. Randel Miller, Watson
Clinic rheumatologist.
</P>
<P>
Merck &amp; Co. removed Vioxx from use Thursday after new study
results showed increased risk of heart attacks and stroke in people
who used it for longer than 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Patients on Vioxx for arthritis or other conditions should be getting
letters from their doctors, although they can call them now.
</P>
<P>
Simply switching to stronger doses of over-the-counter pain medicine
is not necessarily the right option, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
Some of them have an anti-clotting effect that make patients more
likely to bleed. For patients on blood thinners such as Coumadin, the
combination could be highly risky without proper supervision.
</P>
<P>
And older nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and
naproxen, typically called NSAIDs, cause gastrointestinal bleeding in
some patients. That is one reason doctors and patients welcomed the
new NSAIDs known as Cox-2 inhibitors -- Vioxx, Celebrex and Bextra --
as they started entering the market in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Their less-upsetting impact on the stomach was a plus, particularly
with older patients.
</P>
<P>
Concern about possible cardiovascular problems associated with Vioxx,
however, soon arose.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ada Lopez-Mendez, a rheumatology specialist at Winter Haven
Hospital, said patients should return the Vioxx they have.
</P>
<P>
Their doctors can prescribe other Cox-2 inhibitors, or try drugs such
as ibuprofen. They may review patients' conditions to see if they
still need medicine, she and Miller said.
</P>
<P>
Two newer arthritis drugs of the same type are waiting for marketing
approval in the United States, but Miller said they will not be
released without more review of their cardiovascular risks.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the European Medicines Agency in London announced it
would review all drugs of this type.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the risk of an
individual patient having a heart attack or stroke related to Vioxx
is small, the agency also said "there appear to be significant safety
concerns."
</P>
<P>
Results of clinical studies with one drug in a given class do not
necessarily apply to other drugs in the same class, the FDA said.
</P>
<P>
That means Vioxx results cannot automatically be extended to Celebrex
and Bextra, which are in the Cox-2 classification with Vioxx but are
not identical to it.
</P>
<P>
"There's no evidence we're aware of the other Cox-2 drugs have
similar effects, but we don't really have studies that are long
enough (to know)," Miller said.
</P>
<P>
But articles released Wednesday by the New England Journal of
Medicine say Vioxx may not be the only drug of its type that raises
the heart and stroke risk.
</P>
<P>
Studies done five years ago when Pfizer's Celebrex and Merck &amp;
Co.'s Vioxx were approved suggest the same mechanism that inhibits
inflammation and makes them easier on the stomach than traditional
painkillers also blocks a substance that prevents heart problems,
according to Dr. Garret FitzGerald, chairman of pharmacology at the
University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
He led the studies, which were designed by him but funded by the drug
companies.
</P>
<P>
FitzGerald said he thinks the problem of increased risk also applies
to Pfizer's Celebrex and Bextra.
</P>
<P>
Pfizer's medical director, Dr. Gail Cawkwell, insisted that its drugs
are safe. "The data for Celebrex is robust and exceeds, in the length
of patients in studies and in the size of studies, the data Vioxx
has," she said.
</P>
<P>
She called FitzGerald's contention "an interesting theory," but said,
"there is no evidence" of increased risk of heart problems among the
75 million Americans who have taken Celebrex. Long-term studies are
not yet available on Bextra, approved in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The FDA needs to give more guidance in using the remaining COX-2
inhibitors, Fitzgerald said in the Journal article.
</P>
<P>
He said the drugs remain a "rational choice" for patients at low risk
of cardiovascular problems who have had serious gastrointestinal
events (such as bleeding), but he said it would "seem prudent" to
avoid them with patients who have or are at risk of cardiovascular
disease.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report released by the New England Journal, Dr. Eric
Topol of the Cleveland Clinic chastises the FDA for not requiring
Merck to do studies investigating heart problems with Vioxx when
hints of them first appeared years ago.
</P>
<P>
"This represents the largest prescription-drug withdrawal in history,
but had the many warning signs along the way been heeded, such a
debacle could have been prevented," he said.
</P>
<P>
The medical journal published their reports Wednesday on the Internet
-- more than two weeks ahead of their planned publication to help
inform doctors and patients.
</P>
<P>
Until the new study, Vioxx seemed the best alternative for some
patients despite a caution on its label from an earlier study.
</P>
<P>
That included patients for whom older NSAIDs had not controlled pain
and patients who have sulfa allergies, of which Celebrex and Bextra
can trigger a recurrence, Watson Clinic's Miller said.
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of individual variability in medicines," he said.
</P>
<P>
"You have one person do extremely well with a drug and on the other
it wouldn't work."
</P>
<P>
The trial whose results pulled Vioxx off the market was designed to
check how well 25 mg of Vioxx did in preventing recurrence of polyps
in the colon.
</P>
<P>
It was not stopped earlier because trial results did not find
increased risk in the first 18 months of the trial, the FDA said.
They were discovered later.
</P>
<P>
The results of that study came on the heels of an earlier study that
showed a greater number of heart attacks in patients taking Vioxx,
although there were fewer stomach ulcers and bleeding. Information
from the earlier study went on the Vioxx label in April 2002,
according to the FDA.
</P>
<P>
Although that study's findings did not cause Vioxx to be withdrawn,
Miller and Lopez-Mendez said the results put Vioxx lower on their
list for prescribing.
</P>
<P>
Another study -- this one released in August on a review of more than
1 million HMO patients -- found a three-fold risk of cardiovascular
incidents in patients taking 25 mg or more Vioxx, Lopez-Mendez said.
</P>
<P>
The risk was only slightly greater than average with less than 25
milligrams, she said, adding that the American College of
Rheumatology sent members the results of that presentation days
before Merck withdrew Vioxx. That could have made many less likely to
prescribe it.
</P>
<P>
"When there are other alternatives, why risk trying to use the drug
that might have elevated risk?" said Lopez-Mendez, medical director
of rehabilitation services at Winter Haven Hospital. FOR MORE
