Dulling Merck's Pain
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With its stock price down sharply since pulling the painkiller
Vioxx off the market, Merck &amp; Co. adopted a plan guaranteeing large
severance packages to 230 top executives if the company merges or is
taken over. The timing of the ``golden parachutes,'' and their
extension to so many executives, drew complaints from critics who said
the firm's managers didn't deserve such a rich package after the Vioxx
fiasco. Separately, a major pension fund filed suit against Merck,
alleging it misled shareholders about the safety of Vioxx.
