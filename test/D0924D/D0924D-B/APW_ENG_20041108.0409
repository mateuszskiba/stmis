Merck is target of probe over Vioxx recall

Drug maker Merck &amp; Co. said that the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Justice Department are looking into the company's
handling of Vioxx, the blockbuster arthritis drug it pulled off the
market Sept. 30 after safety studies showed it increased the risk of
heart attacks.

<P>
In a regulatory filing Tuesday, Merck said the company is the subject
of a criminal investigation from the Justice Department, which
subpoenaed documents on the company's research, marketing and selling
activities for Vioxx. The company estimates 105 million prescriptions
were written for the drug for 20 million patients in the United
States from May 1999 to August 2004. In 2003, Vioxx had U.S. sales of
about $1.8 billion.

<P>
The SEC also told the company it was beginning its own informal
inquiry regarding the drug.
</P>
<P>
Merck said it has also received a letter from the attorneys general
in five states stating that its return and refund program for unused
Vioxx will not provide consumers with adequate notice and will be
unduly burdensome.
</P>
<P>
Merck said that it will cooperate with all information requests and
investigations.

Shares of Merck fell 43 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $26.14 in the
extended session after closing up 36 cents to $26.57 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
