US Secretary of State Condoleezza 
Rice met Wednesday with British Secretary of State for Northern 
Ireland Peter Hain and reaffirmed support for the implementation of 
the Good Friday accords.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 Good Friday peace deal largely ended three decades of 
intercommunity violence in Northern Ireland and established a 
power-sharing executive and assembly.
</P>
<P>
"The United States continues to support fully the British and 
Irish governments' efforts to implement the Good Friday Accords," 
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said.
</P>
<P>
The United States, he said, welcomed statements made this week 
by British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie 
Ahern that the key to moving forward was for the Irish Republican 
Army (IRA), Northern Ireland's main Catholic paramilitary group, to 
end all violence unequivocally.
</P>
<P>
Blair and Ahern underlined their desire for the quick return of 
a self-governing Northern Ireland and urged the IRA to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
They warned that such a government would only be achieved 
provided that peace prevailed in the British-ruled province.
