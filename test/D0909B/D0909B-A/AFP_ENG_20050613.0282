British government expecting 'imminent' IRA statement

<P>
Britain expects an "imminent" statement 
from the IRA as to whether the Northern Irish paramilitary group is 
to agree to an appeal from its political wing to abandon violence, a 
government minister said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The comments from Northern Ireland Minister Peter Hain -- who 
said the IRA statement could "open a new chapter" for the 
British-ruled region --  came as it was announced that Prime 
Minister Tony Blair and Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern would meet in 
London this week.
</P>
<P>
The pair would meet at the House of Commons on Wednesday, 
officials in Dublin said, with Ahern also holding talks with Ian 
Paisley, leader of Northern Ireland's biggest Protestant political 
group, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
</P>
<P>
London and Dublin are awaiting for an Irish Republican Army 
response to a call from Gerry Adams, leader of the group's Sinn Fein 
political wing, for an end to violence.
</P>
<P>
In April, Adams called on the IRA to "fully embrace and accept" 
democratic means and end all paramilitary activities.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident, now, with an imminent IRA statement expected, 
which I hope will be credible, that it will open a new chapter in 
Northern Irish politics," Hain told BBC Radio Ulster.
</P>
<P>
Hopes are rising in Northern Ireland that the IRA will, by the 
end of June, announce a plan for a complete and swift process of 
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
A deal on the so-called "decommissioning" of IRA weapons was 
almost reached at the end of last year, but foundered on demands 
from the DUP that the process by verified through photographs.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland has seen a virtual end to more than 30 years of 
violence since the landmark 1998 Good Friday peace deal, but Dublin 
and London, as well as an independent monitoring body, have accused 
paramilitary groups of continued criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
The IRA's alleged misdeeds were highlighted by a massive bank 
raid in Belfast in December, blamed by police on the group, as well 
as the murder of Robert McCartney, a Belfast man beaten and stabbed 
to death in a bar in what his relatives say was an attack carried 
out by IRA activists.
