<P>
Northern Ireland's peace process would 
receive a major boost if the Irish Republican Army responds 
positively to appeals to embrace political methods, a leading figure 
in the paramilitary group's political wing said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It would give much needed new momentum to the peace process," 
Sinn Fein chief negotiator Martin McGuinness told a summer school in 
the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that a positive response from the IRA would have an 
immediate and enormous impact on the political situation."
</P>
<P>
In April, Since Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams made a direct 
appeal to IRA "volunteers" to give up all violence and adopt 
democratic methods, since then the Catholic paramilitary group has 
been holding meetings to discuss a response.
</P>
<P>
"I fully support Gerry Adams' appeal and I sincerely hope that 
the IRA does respond to it positively," McGuinness said.
</P>
<P>
The Irish and British governments hope for an answer before the 
August holiday period from the IRA, which declared a ceasefire in 
its campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland ahead of a 1998 
Good Friday peace deal which largely ended 30 years of violence.
</P>
<P>
McGuinness claimed a positive response would deal with the 
"genuine concerns" of Protestant unionists, who want Northern 
Ireland to remain part of Britain, and remove any excuse for 
unionist party leaders refusing to negotiate directly with Sinn 
Fein.
</P>
<P>
He said it would also put "enormous pressure" on Northern 
Ireland's largest party, the hardline Democratic Unionist Party led 
by Ian Paisley, "to come on board the peace process" for the first 
time.
</P>
<P>
"There is no alternative to sharing power with Irish 
republicans; there is no alterative to the all-Ireland architecture 
and the equality agenda of the Good Friday Agreement," McGuinness 
said.
</P>
<P>
Protestant factions in Northern Ireland are adamant that there 
can be no political progress toward a lasting peace settlement 
without a move by the IRA to end all paramilitary and criminal 
activity and a decommissioning of its weapons arsenals.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 peace deal paved the way for a Protestant-Catholic 
power-sharing assembly, but that was suspended more than two years 
ago amid allegations of IRA espionage.
</P>
<P>
British and Irish efforts to revive power-sharing and secure a 
permanent settlement collapsed before Christmas after Sinn Fein 
rejected Protestant demands for photographic proof of IRA weapons 
destruction.
