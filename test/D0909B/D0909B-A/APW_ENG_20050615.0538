IRA must disarm and disband, Irish premier and Protestant hard-liner agree

<P>
In an unusual show of agreement, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and the Rev.
Ian Paisley, the top Protestant politician in Northern Ireland, called Wednesday
for the outlawed IRA to disarm and disband.
</P>
<P>
Ahern and Paisley _ a hard-liner who opposes Irish involvement in Northern
Ireland and didn't begin meeting Ahern until last year _ spoke separately after
a 90-minute meeting at the Irish embassy in London.
</P>
<P>
They said the Irish Republican Army was standing in the way of revived
Catholic-Protestant cooperation in Northern Ireland. Both emphasized that the
IRA must demonstrate its voluntary demise in concrete ways.
</P>
<P>
Ahern said he was hopeful that the IRA would issue a declaration within the next
few months spelling out whether it will disarm and cease all threatening
activities.
</P>
<P>
"To move forward, we need a clear, unambiguous end of all paramilitary and
criminal activity and we need to see the completion of (weapons)
decommissioning," Ahern said.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed, "It is not just words, it is deeds. If we get a statement on
the issues I have mentioned, we would be very happy with the statement. But we
would, naturally enough, want to see that they happen."
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's Good Friday peace accord of 1998 proposed the creation of a
joint Catholic-Protestant administration involving Sinn Fein, the IRA-linked
party that represents most of the province's Catholics. Power-sharing collapsed
in 2002 following chronic arguments over IRA activities and weaponry.
</P>
<P>
Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party, which represents most of the territory's
British Protestant majority, says it won't cooperate with Sinn Fein unless the
IRA backs up words with meaningful public action _ particularly the publication
of photos of its disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The IRA rejected those terms in December and since has been implicated in a
string of criminal scandals, including a world-record bank robbery, the knife
slaying of a Catholic man and a money-laundering network.
</P>
<P>
Paisley emphasized Wednesday he would wait for at least six months following an
IRA peace declaration to see whether the group followed through with
deeds.
</P>
<P>
The IRA was supposed to have scrapped all of its stockpiled weapons by mid-2000
in support of the Good Friday deal. Instead it began a secrecy-shrouded process
in October 2001 and halted it in October 2003 still in possession of much of its
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has their tongue out waiting for a statement from the IRA. We haven't
got our tongues out. ... We are looking for action," Paisley
said.
</P>
<P>
Ahern was also meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has worked
closely with Ahern since 1997 to broker compromise in Northern Ireland, which is
a part of the United Kingdom.
