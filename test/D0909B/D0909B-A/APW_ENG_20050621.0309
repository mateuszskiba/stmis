IRA must verify it has ceased all activities, British governor says

<P>
Any public pledge by the Irish Republican Army to cease all activities,
including crime, should be weighed over time to test whether it's genuine, the
British governor of Northern Ireland said Tuesday.

Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Hain said the government was soon expecting the
IRA to issue a new peace declaration that would address a long-standing demand
for the outlawed group to disarm fully and disband. He said until the IRA did
this, Protestant leaders would refuse to share power with Sinn Fein, the
IRA-linked party that represents most Catholics.

<P>
"For that trust to be restored there must be a clear, definitive and permanent
end to paramilitary activity and its associated criminality," Hain said in a
speech to the annual conference of the Irish Congress of Trade
Unions.
</P>
<P>
"Words are not enough, but they are an important start, and I hope people would
not underestimate the significance of a credible statement from the IRA," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But in a nod to Protestant leaders' unwillingness to form a power-sharing
government immediately with Sinn Fein, Hain said an unspecified delay would be
reasonable to determine whether the IRA was telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
"A commitment in words needs to be capable of being verified over a period of
time so that everyone can see that the commitment is real and lasting," he
said.
