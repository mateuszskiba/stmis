British, Irish PMs take stock of Northern Ireland deadlock

<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and 
Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern were to chair the first major review 
of the Northern Ireland situation since the British general election 
in May at a meeting in London later Monday.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which will include senior ministers from both sides, 
were being held under the auspices of the British-Irish 
Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC) which was set up under the 1998 
Good Friday peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The discussions were to cover political developments in Northern 
Ireland, security and criminal justice matters, policing, the 
marching season involving the Protestant loyalist Orange Order, 
human rights and equality, cross-border matters in Ireland and 
Anglo-Irish questions.
</P>
<P>
BIIGC meetings are normally only attended by the Irish foreign 
minister and the British secretary of state for Northern Ireland but 
there is provision to scale them up to "summit level" involving both 
prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
"The holding of a meeting of the BIIGC at summit level is a 
demonstration of the close working and high level partnership 
between the two governments," the Irish government statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It is also a demonstration of the commitment of the two 
governments to pursue progress across the range of issues embraced 
by the Good Friday agreement."
</P>
<P>
The London summit was taking place as all sides in Northern 
Ireland wait to see if the Protestant marching season passes 
peacefully and if the Irish Republican Army (IRA) will respond 
positively to an appeal from Gerry Adams, leader of its Sinn Fein 
political wing, to disarm and fully embrace democracy.
</P>
<P>
Protestant factions in Northern Ireland are adamant that there 
can be no political progress toward a lasting peace settlement 
without a move by the IRA to end all criminal and paramilitary 
activity.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters earlier Monday, Blair repeated his call 
for republicans to unequivocally give up violence and commit 
themselves to wholly democratic methods.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is going to be very difficult to persuade unionism 
of the sincerity of any republican move, which is why that move has 
got to be clear and bold," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's immensely important that they do make this move... If it 
is done and it is done genuinely and violence is genuinely given up, 
then the obligation then transfers to unionists to make sure that 
they drop their opposition to going into a power-sharing 
executive."
</P>
<P>
The IRA declared a ceasefire in its campaign to end British rule 
in Northern Ireland before the 1998 peace deal, which largely ended 
30 years of sectarian violence in the province.
</P>
<P>
The agreement paved the way for a Protestant-Catholic 
power-sharing assembly that was suspended more than two years ago 
amid a crisis of confidence and allegations of IRA espionage.
</P>
<P>
British and Irish efforts to revive power-sharing and secure a 
permanent settlement collapsed before Christmas after Sinn Fein 
rejected Protestant demands for photographic proof of weapons 
destruction.
