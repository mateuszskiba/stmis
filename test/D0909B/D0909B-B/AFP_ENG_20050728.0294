Gerry Adams, the leader of the Sinn Fein 
political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), confirmed 
Thursday that the Roman Catholic paramilitary group was on the verge 
of making a significant statement.
</P>
<P>
"The forthcoming IRA statement will challenge Irish Republicans 
(Sinn Fein) and nationalists (other Catholics). I appeal to everyone 
to carefully read what the army has to say and to remain united and 
steadfast," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The IRA statement will also challenge others, especially the 
two governments and the (Protestant) Unionists," Adams said in a 
statement distributed by Sinn Fein in the Irish capital of Dublin.
</P>
<P>
"The Dublin political establishment in particular will have a 
lot of soul searching to do, if those in the political leadership 
are to meet the needs of the upcoming period," Adams said, without 
elaborating.
</P>
<P>
The underground guerrilla movement which has been fighting to 
end British rule in Northern Ireland for 30 years is expected to 
respond to British-Irish calls for it to renounce violence once and 
for all.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was reinforced on April 6 when Adams urged the IRA to 
take the "historic" decision to abandon the armed struggle and 
engage in a political process for peace in Northern Ireland.
