Senior figures in Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army-linked party, departed
Wednesday for the United States ahead of an expected major new peace declaration
from the outlawed IRA.
</P>
<P>
The British, Irish and U.S. governments have been pressing since December for
the IRA to disarm fully and disband in support of Northern Ireland's 1998 peace
accord. The pact's key goal _ a joint Catholic-Protestant administration for the
British territory _ has been hold since 2002 because of Protestant refusal to
cooperate with Sinn Fein, the major Catholic-backed party.
</P>
<P>
The British and Irish governments both expect the IRA to release a new policy
statement soon, perhaps on Thursday, outlining its future intentions. Both
governments insist the IRA must disarm fully and renounce violence and criminal
activity _ commitments the IRA has refused to give in the past.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein deputy leader Martin McGuinness and the party's North American
representative, Rita O'Hare, were planning to meet supporters in the U.S.
Congress and President George W. Bush's envoy to Northern Ireland, Mitchell
Reiss.
</P>
<P>
In a sign of recent U.S. pressure on the Sinn Fein-IRA movement, O'Hare in
February was barred from traveling into the United States _ the first time that
happened since she became Sinn Fein's senior U.S.-based lobbyist in 1998. O'Hare
has been on the run from British justice since the early 1970s in Northern
Ireland, where she absconded on bail while awaiting trial on charge of
attempting to murder British soldiers.
