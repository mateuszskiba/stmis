UN Secretary General Kofi Annan 
on Thursday hailed the Irish Republican Army (IRA)'s pledge to end 
its armed struggle for a united Northern Ireland and urged all 
parties to seize the opportunity to consolidate their power-sharing 
agreement.

"The Secretary-General welcomes the announcement by the Irish 
Republican Army (IRA) that it has decided to end armed actions in 
Northern Ireland and disarm," Annan said through his spokesman, 
Stephane Dujarric. "This decision, if fully implemented, will be a 
watershed in the history of Northern Ireland."

The IRA on Thursday ordered its militants to end the armed 
campaign in Northern Ireland and become a political movement, the 
paramilitary group said in a historic statement.

But the statement said the organization would not disband as 
North Ireland's leading Protestants demand.

Annan expressed the hope that IRA "will commit fully to the 
obligation it has just undertaken" and called "on all parties 
concerned to seize this unique opportunity to consolidate the Good 
Friday (power-sharing) Agreement.
