Hopes Northern Ireland's Irish 
Republican Army will make a long-awaited statement committing itself 
to democratic means were raised Tuesday as Ireland's deputy prime 
minister said she expected news later this week.
</P>
<P>
Mary Harney, leader of the Progressive Democrat Party, the 
junior partner in Prime Minister Bertie Ahern's ruling coalition, 
said she hoped the IRA statement would see an end to "criminality in 
Ireland in all its forms once and for all".
</P>
<P>
In April, Gerry Adams, the leader of the political wing of the 
IRA, Sinn Fein, made a direct appeal to the Roman Catholic 
paramilitary group to embrace purely political and democratic 
activity.
</P>
<P>
The Irish and British governments had been hoping for a response 
to the call at some point during the summer.
</P>
<P>
"I certainly hope it (the statement) will be substantial," 
Harney told Ireland's RTE state radio.
</P>
<P>
"There have been many false dawns. I hope on this occasion that 
it is not a false dawn and that we can put the muddy past of 
paramilitarism totally and utterly behind us, and that everybody 
embraces politics and all that that involves -- peaceful politics 
and democratic politics."
</P>
<P>
The IRA, which declared a ceasefire in its campaign to end 
British rule in Northern Ireland before the 1998 Good Friday peace 
deal that largely ended 30 years of violence, has been holding 
consultations with members.
</P>
<P>
The Irish media has reported that three senior Sinn Fein 
leaders, including Adams and chief negotiator Martin McGuinness, 
have stepped down from their posts on the seven-man ruling body of 
the IRA.
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented charge in January, Irish Justice Minister 
Michael McDowell claimed the trio were leaders of both the political 
and military wings of the movement.
</P>
<P>
However, in a joint statement the Sinn Fein leaders 
"categorically" denied they were members of the outlawed IRA's 
ruling body, and accused McDowell of abusing his office.
</P>
<P>
Even if the IRA commits itself to ending violence, Northern 
Ireland could still be bogged down by the sort of factional 
bickering which saw a solution to the current political deadlock 
scuppered just before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
Protestant factions in Northern Ireland, particularly the 
Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) led by veteran hardliner Ian 
Paisley, are adamant that there can be no lasting settlement without 
a move by the IRA to end all paramilitary and criminal activity and 
to decommission its weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Good Friday agreement paved the way for a 
Protestant-Catholic power-sharing assembly in Belfast, but that was 
suspended more than two years ago amid allegations of IRA 
espionage.
</P>
<P>
Hopes of a new political settlement were dashed in December when 
moves to destroy IRA arms caches were halted following Protestant 
demands the process be photographed, something Sinn Fein rejected as 
an unnecessary humiliation.
