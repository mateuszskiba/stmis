Apple to announce a switch to Intel chips: reports

NEW YORK, June 6
</DATELINE>

<P>
Apple Computer is expected to announce 
Monday that it will begin using Intel chips in its Macintosh 
machines next year, ending a 14-year alliance with IBM and its 
processors, according to US media reports.
</P>
<P>
The move is a major change in strategy for Apple, according to 
The Wall Street Journal's online edition. The New York Times called 
it "an unprecedented gamble."
</P>
<P>
"This is a seismic shift in the world of personal computing and 
consumer electronics," Richard Doherty, president of a computer and 
consumer electronics industry consulting firm, told the Times.
</P>
<P>
"It is bound to rock the industry, but it will also be a 
phenomenal engineering challenge for Apple," he said.
</P>
<P>
Apple CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs is set to announce the 
switch Monday at Apple's annual developer's conference in San 
Francisco, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The change could cause disruptions for Macintosh users as 
software developers scramble to make Apple programs run on Intel 
chips.
</P>
<P>
But it is a high-profile win for Intel, the world's largest chip 
maker, which is trying to adjust after the erosion of its long-term 
partnership with Microsoft, the papers said.
</P>
<P>
"For IBM, the end of the Apple partnership means the loss of a 
prestigious customer, but not one that is any longer very important 
to IBM's sales or profits," according to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
IBM has long since expanded beyond the personal computer market. 
It makes chips for Sony and Nintendo's video game machines as well 
as specialized processors for Internet routers and for cell phone 
technology.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft dealt Intel a blow last year when it said it would use 
an IBM processor in its next generation video game console, the Xbox 
360, due to hit stores later this year.
</P>
<P>
"It is likely that Intel forged the alliance with Apple in an 
effort to counter the powerful home entertainment and game systems 
coming from Microsoft and Sony," the Times said.
</P>
<P>
Apple for its part had tried to counter the Microsoft-Intel 
partnership when it forged the alliance in 1991 with IBM and 
Motorola.
</P>
<P>
Today, IBM supplies about half of the microprocessors used by 
Apple, and Freescale Semiconductor, a spinoff of Motorola, supplies 
the rest.
</P>
<P>
But in recent times Apple has been alarmed by IBM's failure to 
update its Power PC chip, the Times said, citing analysts.
