APPLE PLANS TO SWITCH FROM IBM TO INTEL FOR CHIPS

Steven P. Jobs is preparing to take an
unprecedented gamble by abandoning Apple Computer's 14-year commitment to chips
developed by IBM and Motorola in favor of Intel processors
for his Macintosh computers, industry executives informed of the decision
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The move is a chesslike gambit in a broader industry turf
war that pits the traditional personal computer industry against an
emerging world of consumer electronics focused on the digital home.
</P>
<P>
"This is a seismic shift in the world of personal computing
and consumer electronics," said Richard Doherty, president of the Envisioneering
Group, a Seaford, N.Y., computer and consumer electronics industry consulting
firm. "It is bound to rock the industry, but it
will also be a phenomenal engineering challenge for Apple."
</P>
<P>
Jobs is expected to announce the transition to Intel chips at
Apple's annual developer conference, which will begin here Monday. Apple's
intention to shift to Intel chips beginning in 2006 was
reported Friday by CNET News.com, a technology news service. The
Wall Street Journal had previously reported that Apple and IBM
were negotiating.

Apple, according to analysts, has become increasingly alarmed by IBM's failure
to deliver a new version of its Power PC chip,
called the G5, that does not generate much heat --
a crucial feature for notebook computers, which do not have
as much room for fans and ventilation as desktop machines.
</P>
<P>
Apple's notebooks now use the older G4 chips, made by Freescale
Semiconductor, which was spun off from Motorola last year.
</P>
<P>
"That's a huge looming problem for Apple, if it can't keep
up with Intel notebooks in performance," said Charles Wolf, an
analyst for Needham &amp; Co. "And that's been an IBM
problem. IBM hasn't delivered a cool-running G5."
</P>
<P>
Jobs is scheduled to take the stage Monday to face his
software developers, an important constituency he must convince of the
wisdom of the shift. It is the software developers who
will need to do the hard work of making their
programs run on Intel chips if Jobs' strategy is to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
Apple must be able to persuade software developers who make business
and graphics programs for the Macintosh -- Microsoft, Adobe, Quark
and others -- to overhaul their code.
</P>
<P>
"That's a huge challenge for Apple, to win the software developers
over and drag them along," said Wolf, the Needham analyst.
