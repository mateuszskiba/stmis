<P>
Apple Computer, for years a niche 
operator, took another step toward the market mainstream Monday by 
abandoning IBM chips in favour of Intel ones to power its trendy 
Macintosh machines.
</P>
<P>
Chief executive Steve Jobs told 3,800 software developers 
attending an annual Apple conference here that new Macs will come 
with Intel microprocessors "by this time next year".
</P>
<P>
Under the alliance with the world's biggest chip maker, all 
Apple Macs will be equipped to handle Intel rather than IBM 
processors by the end of 2007.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to provide our customers with the best personal 
computers in the world, and looking ahead Intel has the strongest 
processor roadmap by far," Jobs said.
</P>
<P>
"It's been 10 years since our transition to the (IBM) PowerPC, 
and we think Intel's technology will help us create the best 
personal computers for the next 10 years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The switch to Intel chips, which are already found on most 
computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system, could 
allow Apple to cut prices of its desirable but expensive systems.
</P>
<P>
The company has been trying hard to cash in on the runaway 
success of its iPod digital music player, recently launching a "Mac 
Mini" computer to lure customers away from Windows PCs.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said that Apple's fanatically loyal fan base 
may yet look askance at the Intel tie-up.
</P>
<P>
"The world associates Intel with Windows," said Elise Bauer of 
the Pacifica Group technology consultancy.
</P>
<P>
"Intel is coupled with Windows to the point where we call it a 
'Wintel' box. If Apple is now embracing Intel, then there's some 
rebranding for both companies, Intel and Apple, to do around that," 
she said.
</P>
<P>
Software developers will have to rewrite Apple programs to 
enable them to run on Intel-powered Macs.
</P>
<P>
Apple could also lose sales in the coming months as customers 
wait for the switch to the more powerful Intel processors.
</P>
<P>
But Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster predicted that the 
long-term gains from the new partnership will outweigh any 
"short-term pain".
</P>
<P>
Using Intel will give Apple a consistent supply of chips, bring 
the price of Macs more in line with their competitors, and reach a 
potentially larger developer community, Munster said.
</P>
<P>
Intel expressed delight at Apple's switch.
</P>
<P>
"We are thrilled to have the world's most innovative personal 
computer company as a customer," said Intel chief executive Paul 
Otellini, who was introduced to the conference here by an exuberant 
Jobs.
</P>
<P>
"Apple helped found the PC industry and throughout the years has 
been known for fresh ideas and new approaches," Otellini said.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to providing advanced chip technologies, and to 
collaborating on new initiatives, to help Apple continue to deliver 
innovative products for years to come."
</P>
<P>
IBM minimised the development. It has sold its PC division to 
Chinese group Lenovo and, in the chip market, is concentrating its 
efforts on making powerful processors for games machines made by 
Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the company said it was "aggressively moving the 
power architecture beyond the PC".
</P>
<P>
Apple was said to be unhappy with IBM's slow pace of development 
of a G5 chip for its PowerBook and iBook laptop computers. The chip 
is already used in Mac desktops but generates too much heat for the 
laptops.
</P>
<P>
At least one of the software developers at the San Francisco 
conference said that Jobs' reversal will make it easier for them to 
write programs for both the Apple and Windows systems.
</P>
<P>
"We won't have to release two copies of applications for 
different platforms," said Jiva DeVoe, whose Arizona software firm 
makes project-management applications.
