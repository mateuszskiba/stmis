APPLE UNVEILS TWO NEW MACS WITH INTEL PROCESSORS

<P>
Leaping six months ahead of schedule, Apple Computer
on Tuesday showed off two new computers powered by Intel
microprocessors, giving the company new leverage in winning over PC
customers.
</P>
<P>
In a 90-minute address at the Macworld trade show here, Apple
Chairman Steve Jobs unveiled a new iMac desktop computer powered
by an Intel dual-core processor that he said runs more
than twice as fast as current models but costs the
same.
</P>
<P>
The news was received with typical enthusiasm by hundreds of Mac
devotees on opening day of the four-day show.
</P>
<P>
The new iMac went on sale Tuesday at $1,300 and $1,700,
depending on screen size and other features.
</P>
<P>
Jobs also showed off a new line of Intel-powered laptop computers
called MacBook Pro, which he said are four to five
times faster than the PowerBook models they replace. Priced at
$2,000 and $2,500, the MacBooks will begin shipping in February.
</P>
<P>
The announcements impressed both analysts and investors, who bid Apple stock
up $4.81 a share to $80.66 on the Nasdaq. Intel
shares fell 35 cents to close at $26.12.
</P>
<P>
It also surprised some Apple watchers who had anticipated new additions
to the company's wildly successful line of iPods.
</P>
<P>
By shifting to Intel from its longtime use of PowerPC chips
built by Motorola and IBM, Apple gets a significant boost
in performance and, even more importantly, experts say, a comfort
level with current users of Windows PCs.
</P>
<P>
"Now, when you buy a Mac, it will say "'Intel Inside.'
That will be a comforting factor," said Jim Dalrymple, news
director for Macworld magazine.
</P>
<P>
"The move to Intel is critical to Apple's future because it
allows (the company) to attract the hard-core PC crowd," added
analyst Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies. "If they show
they can run applications two or three or four times
faster, they will get a lot of attention."
</P>
<P>
The Intel introductions come on the heels of a dazzling 2005
when 32 million iPods sold, 14 million of them in
the fourth quarter alone. In 2004, the company sold just
8.3 million of the devices.
</P>
<P>
Apple's sales from October through December hit a record $5.7 billion,
compared with $3.49 billion in the same quarter a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
By focusing on its new Intel-based products, Apple is appealing to
its power users and laying groundwork for expanding its share
beyond the estimated 4 percent of the personal computer market
that it now holds.
</P>
<P>
Experts called the accelerated Intel introduction a big advantage for Apple,
which had previously predicted that Intel-powered Macs wouldn't be available
until midyear. Getting to market early gives power-hungry Mac users
a reason to buy a new machine and software makers
new incentives to develop programs that run on the new
platform.
</P>
<P>
"This is an amazing effort, given the short amount of time
they had to work on it," said Michael Gartenberg, an
analyst with Jupiter Research.
</P>
<P>
While only one Intel-powered Mac is available right now, Jobs said
the entire line of Macs will shift to Intel by
the end of 2006. Software developers also are racing to
write programs that will run on both the Intel and
older PowerPC.
</P>
<P>
The Intel announcement was accompanied by an appearance by Intel Chairman
Paul Otellini, who walked on stage wearing a white "bunny
suit" used in chip manufacturing. "Steve, I want to report
that Intel is ready to go," he said.
</P>
<P>
For years Apple shunned Intel products -- and even mocked them
in its television ads. But last June it announced it
would use Intel chips, partly motivated by an inability to
get its G5 microprocessors to run effectively in its PowerBook
laptop computers.
</P>
<P>
Intel's dual-core chips are a much better fit for the laptop
platform, analysts say. Preceding Tuesday's unveiling, Apple also showed off
improvements to its suite of iLife software, which includes photo,
video and music editing capabilities.
</P>
<P>
New to the $79 lineup is software that lets users more
easily produce podcasts and create their own Web sites.
</P>
<P>
"This takes emerging consumer activities, such as blogging and podcasting, and
makes them drop-dead simple and attractive," said Van Baker, an
analyst with Gartner. He called the new Apple products "a
home run."
</P>
<P>
While Apple surprised observers with its quick conversion to the Intel
platform, it also defied speculation that it would introduce a
new iPod and perhaps unveil a new Macintosh designed to
be a command center for other consumer electronics in the
home, such as stereos and televisions.
</P>
<P>
But analyst Bajarin said Apple is likely to introduce new iPods
later this year, and media center Macs might not be
on the near horizon, even though companies such as Microsoft
Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. are pushing hard to market such
products.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we'll see that from Apple in the short
term," he said. "Apple has a tendency to let other
companies get the arrows in their backs, then Apple comes
in and does it better."
