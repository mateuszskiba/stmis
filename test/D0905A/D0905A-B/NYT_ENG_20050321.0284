Banking giant Goldman Sachs said Monday it will buy
Zilkha Renewable Energy, a Houston firm with about a half-dozen
wind energy projects operating or under development.
</P>
<P>
The deal will add even more power generating assets to the
bank's existing portfolio and put a deeper set of pockets
behind wind projects in California, Illinois, Kansas, New York and
other states.
</P>
<P>
Terms were not released.
</P>
<P>
Wind power accounts for less than 1 percent of all electricity
generated in the United States, but new wind turbine installation
has grown by 24 percent a year since 2000, according
to the American Wind Energy Association. And 2,000 megawatts of
wind farms are expected to be installed this year, a
30 percent increase over existing capacity. One megawatt is enough
power to light about 300 homes.
</P>
<P>
"Goldman Sachs believes that wind and other renewable forms of energy
will become an increasingly important part of the world's energy
mix, and we aspire to play a leading role in
this high-growth industry" said Goldman Sachs Chairman and CEO Henry
Paulson Jr. in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Goldman Sachs has major holdings in energy development, energy finance, power
marketing and commodities trading. The company has more than 30
gas and coal-fired power plants acquired through deals with National
Energy Gas &amp; Transmission, El Paso Corp., and Congentrix, and
has interests in wind farms in Oregon, Wyoming and near
Palm Springs, Calif.
</P>
<P>
Zilkha has interests in two projects currently generating power -- the
75-megawatt Blue Canyon Wind Farm in Okla., and the 24-megawatt
Tierras Morenas wind farm in Costa Rica -- and many
other projects in various stages of development. The two closest
to completion are the 200-megawatt Flat Rock project in New
York and a 150-megawatt second phase of the Blue Canyon
project.
</P>
<P>
Zilkha Renewable co-owners Selim Zilkha and his son Michael Zilkha will
maintain a financial interest in the company, while Michael will
continue to serve on the board. The business will continue
to be based in Houston with the same management team.
</P>
<P>
For many years the wind power business has been the beneficiary
of an $18 per megawatt-hour federal tax credit that has
been allowed to expire three times in the last six
years, notes Michael Swisher, executive director of the American Wind
Energy Association. The credit is to expire again at the
end of this year, and the industry group is calling
for the credit to be extended for at least five
years.
</P>
<P>
"The 'on again, off again' nature of the tax credit is
more a function of the political process," said Michael Skelly,
vice president of development for Zilkha. "Our view is that
there will continue to be support at the popular level
and within Congress for wind energy."
</P>
<P>
The tax credits certainly help the wind energy industry look more
attractive to investors, but as prices for power plant fuels
continue to rise and the wind turbines become more efficient,
the industry becomes more competitive on its own terms.
</P>
<P>
Selim Zilkha, 77, and Michael Zilkha, 50, are well known in
Houston for their ties to the energy industry and for
a number of high-profile philanthropic efforts.
</P>
<P>
The elder Zilkha was at one time the largest single shareholder
of El Paso Corp. In 2003, he helped fund an
unsuccessful bid to replace the company's board of directors. He
has since sold his shares in the company.
