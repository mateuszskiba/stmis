<P>
On the site where border 
guards used to keep watch on the western outpost of the Soviet 
Union, Baltic European Union newcomer Estonia is erecting a wind 
farm to generate clean electricity.
</P>
<P>
The wind-swept Pakri peninsula, which juts into the Baltic Sea 
60 kilometres (36 miles) west of the capital Tallinn, once hosted a 
training centre for Soviet border guards. The nearby town of 
Paldiski was a key Soviet nuclear submarine training ground.
</P>
<P>
Today, sleek silver arms of the state-of-art wind power turbines 
dot the site which was off-limits to civilians throughout the five 
decades of Soviet occupation from 1940 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
The first three windmills of the Pakri Wind Farm have just been 
put into operation, with five others to follow before the end of the 
month.
</P>
<P>
When the farm is fully up and running, it is expected to supply 
one percent of Estonia's energy needs, and a some 10,000 Estonian 
households are expected to get electricity from the farm.
</P>
<P>
"Paldiski has been associated with the Soviet border guards and 
military pollution," said Hannu Lamp, managing director of the 
Tuulepargid company which is developing the wind farm. 
</P>
<P>
"From now on, it will have a new side to it, as a clean energy 
place."
</P>
<P>
Tuulepargid is the Estonian subsidiary of Danish-based Global 
Green Energy.
</P>
<P>
The streamlined wind turbines with a hub height of 80 metres 
(yards) and rotor diamete 3,800 residents has 
struggled with its Soviet military legacy. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to changing the face of Paldiski, the Parki Wind 
Farm is setting a precedent in the region in the carbon pollution 
quota market.
</P>
<P>
Under the Kyoto Protocol's implementation project, 0.5 million 
tons of reduced greenhouse gas emissions will be sold to Finland.
</P>
<P>
"It's among the very first wind power projects anywhere where 
the economic feasibility is achieved through the sale of CO2 
reductions under the joint implementation scheme of the Kyoto 
Protocol," Lamp says.
</P>
<P>
On January 1, the EU opened a market for trading in carbon 
dioxide and other gases which are the main culprits for global 
warming.
</P>
<P>
The total investment cost of the Pakri project is 24 million 
euros.
</P>
<P>
The wind farm owner, Pakri Tuulepark, is a subsidiary of 
Norway's Vardar energy group.
</P>
<P>
Most of Estonia's energy is generated using oil-shale fueled 
power plants, which are big pollutants.
</P>
<P>
With an expected annual production of 56 GWh (GigaWatt hours), 
the Pakri wind farm will meet about one per cent of Estonia's net 
electricity consumption, and thus contribute to achieving Estonia's 
target of providing 5.1 percent of its electricity needs from 
renewable sources by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
Developers have already made plans for building more wind farms 
on other former Soviet military installations in Estonia.
