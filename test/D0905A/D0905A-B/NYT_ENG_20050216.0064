BORDER BID MAY IMPERIL MASS. WIND FARM
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In a move that could give Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney more
power over the proposed Cape Cod wind farm, state and
federal officials appear to have come up with a unique
plan: Move the coastline.
</P>
<P>
State officials said Tuesday that a pile of rocks the size
of a sport utility vehicle in Nantucket Sound may redefine
the borders of Massachusetts, expanding state waters about 12 square
miles. The expansion would push back federal waters, which could
imperil a developer's bid to erect the country's first offshore
wind farm, 130 turbines in the sound.
</P>
<P>
The US Minerals Management Service is expected to post a notice
about the border change in the Federal Registry by the
end of the month, said Jon Carlisle, a spokesman for
the Executive Office of Transportation, which oversees state boundaries. State
waters stretch 3 miles from where officials draw the border.
Federal waters extend from that point to another 200 miles
offshore.
</P>
<P>
"From our review of the landmass, that's the appropriate new border,"
said Carlisle, who declined to comment on whether Romney pushed
for the new borders to curtail the wind project. "Really
one thing has nothing to do with another."
</P>
<P>
Romney and other state politicians, such as Senator Edward M. Kennedy,
oppose the project's planned location, but they have limited power
to block it if it is entirely within federal waters.
</P>
<P>
Last July, Romney asked the Army Corps of Engineers to postpone
its long-awaited review of the proposed wind farm, arguing the
newly discovered rocks might require changing the state border.
</P>
<P>
If that happened, he suggested in a letter, the developer might
have to redraw plans or seek new permits from state
agencies. "This may dramatically alter the proposal your agency is
currently reviewing," the governor wrote. An Army Corps official dismissed
the request at the time as a thinly veiled attempt
to stop the project.
</P>
<P>
While details remained sketchy Tuesday night, the new boundary appears to
cut into as much as 10 percent of the wind
farm's proposed footprint, affecting 10 to 13 turbines, state officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Cape Wind Associates, the project's developer, has seen its proposed turbines
become a focal point in a growing national debate over
ocean management. A company official said Tuesday night that they
had not seen the proposal, but that they doubted it
would seriously affect the project. The company has already reduced
its original proposal by 40 turbines.
</P>
<P>
A US Army Corps of Engineers draft environmental impact report on
the project is in a public comment period until later
this month. The Army Corps is expected to make a
final ruling on whether the project can be constructed within
the next year, the biggest hurdle that Cape Wind must
overcome.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to await receiving this document, and we want
to evaluate it closely before we respond," said Mark Rodgers,
a Cape Wind spokesman. "At this time, it does not
appear this will have any significant impact on the Cape
Wind Project."
</P>
<P>
The effort to change the state's borders began about a year
ago, after the Minerals Management Service asked the Massachusetts Highway
Department to survey the landmass, which is about 2Â½ miles
off Cape Cod, Carlisle said. The Highway Department, which documents
state lines, determined the landmass to be a "natural occurrence"
and recommended the federal agency change the state's borders, he
said.
