The Netherlands on Wednesday granted licenses for seven offshore wind parks as
the country seeks to boost renewable energy sources.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Science said it expected as many as 20 wind farms, with up to
2,000 turbines, to be constructed off the North Sea coast in the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
The names of the companies granted construction permission were not released,
but the statement said they had applied first and submitted environmental impact
studies.

<P>
"To reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, the Netherlands has set a target of
6,000 megawatts of wind energy," the statement said. "The first parks will be
built by 2006."
</P>
<P>
Two projects have already begun.

The British energy company BP PLC has started work on a windmill park in the
Amsterdam harbor with peak capacity of nine megawatts, enough to provide
electrical power to around 5,000 houses.

The country's first major offshore wind turbine project, with 100 megawatts of
capacity, is under co-management by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Cos. and
Dutch utilities company Nuon NV.
