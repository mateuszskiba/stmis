<P>
The Irish authorities on Wednesday ruled 
out a proposal for a wind farm overlooking one of Ireland's oldest 
religious sites after objections from pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
The Hibernian Wind Power company wanted to build 12 wind 
turbines on a site overlooking St Patrick's Purgatory on Station 
Island in Lough Derg, the country's most arduous pilgrimage venue.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the sanctuary, the Friends of Lough Derg, said the 
development would overlook the ancient monument and traditional 
pilgrimage site and "interfere with its tranquillity both audibly 
and visibly".
</P>
<P>
Planning Board inspector Stephen O'Sullivan concluded the wind 
farm and its 65 metre (200-foot) high turbines would "seriously 
injure the visual setting of Lough Derg in a manner which diminished 
its cultural heritage value".
</P>
<P>
The island in the Donegal lake near the border with British 
ruled Northern Ireland is amongst the oldest centres of Christian 
pilgrimage in the world, supposedly dating back to the 6th century.
</P>
<P>
A regime of medieval mortification and cleansing for barefoot 
pilgrims is still practised today.
</P>
<P>
It involves three days of fasting, reciting mantra-type prayers 
while walking on the sharp stones of the island's 'penitential beds' 
and no sleep for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The Purgatory got its name from a legend that Ireland's patron 
saint, Patrick, endured the temptation of the devil in a cave on the 
island.
</P>
<P>
Pilgrims have ranged from King Harold of England in 1050 to 
Ireland's President Mary McAleese.
</P>
<P>
Last year an estimated 30,000 people from 27 countries made the 
pilgrimage.
