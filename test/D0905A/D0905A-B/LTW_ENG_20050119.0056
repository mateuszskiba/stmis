Windmills Bloom in an Unusual Spot

GUANTANAMO BAY, Cuba

<P>
Four new windmill towers and turbines
rising from the crown of John Paul Jones Hill will begin powering the
U.S. Navy base here next month, saving $1.5 million in annual oil
imports, reducing pollution and showing energy-starved communist
neighbors what they are missing.
</P>
<P>
The wind-generation project that will provide 25 percent to 30
percent of the base's energy needs is a rare embrace of renewable
resources for the U.S. military, which can seldom justify the high
start-up costs or efficiently extend new technologies to the small,
scattered communities they serve.
</P>
<P>
At Guantanamo, where the population has grown fourfold since the
base began housing hundreds of suspected enemy combatants captured
mostly in Afghanistan, favorable winds and Pentagon-mandated energy
independence have converged to allow the base to boast the largest
stand-alone hybrid wind and diesel power system in the world,
according to its developers.
</P>
<P>
Two of the four windmills, each capable of generating 950 kilowatts
of electricity, are operational, and the other two will be online by
the end of the month, said the Naval Facilities Engineering Command's
Mark Leighton, who is overseeing the project.
</P>
<P>
Augmenting the wind power are two new diesel generators that
operate more efficiently and cleanly than the Cold War-era units they
are replacing, which will boost annual fuel savings to $2.3 million
once all the new technology is activated in the next few weeks,
Leighton said. The equipment also will cut carbon dioxide output at
these pristine southern shores by 13 million pounds a year.
</P>
<P>
Though the wind project boasts economic and environmental advances,
those behind it concede there is little likelihood of expansion, here
or at other military bases.
</P>
<P>
Guantanamo is unique in its need to remain separate from its
communist-ruled host and neighbor, and the narrow hilltop where the
four stanchions are planted cannot accommodate more. The pillars
standing 185 feet above the hilltop are embedded 35 feet into the
ground, each tethered below the surface with 22 ``soil nails.'' Other
high land on the windward side of the base divided by Guantanamo Bay
might be suitable, but the cost would be prohibitive compared with the
benefit, Leighton said.
</P>
<P>
Similar wind parks have been erected at two other military
installations, said Beverly Wade, project facilitator for a Navy
program that invites private contractors to invest in more
efficient-energy development in return for the project's savings. She
said other renewable-energy projects on military bases included
solar-heated swimming pools at the Norfolk Naval Station and
ground-source heat pumps at Oceania Naval Air Station, both in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
``The problem with renewables in the past has been that it's more
expensive up front and not necessarily tried-and-true technology,''
Wade said. ``Now it's turning out that with the cost of (fossil-fuel)
energy, renewable prices aren't looking so bad.''
</P>
<P>
The Guantanamo contractor, Noresco of Connecticut, invested $20
million in the windmills and new diesel generators. The company is
entitled to the projects' savings for 14 years, which Leighton
estimated at $41 million. The windmills have life spans of at least 20
years, meaning the Navy will enjoy the savings for several years
beyond the contractor's repayment term.
</P>
<P>
Guantanamo has been self-sustaining in utilities for 40 years, able
to produce its own water and electricity to remain independent of the
Cuban government, said the base public works officer, Cmdr. Jeffrey
Johnston. After Cuban leader Fidel Castro threatened to cut off water
to the base in 1964, a desalination plant was built, providing an
independent source but boosting electricity demands that until now had
been met by diesel generators.
</P>
<P>
The power is mostly needed to produce water, Johnston said, and
Guantanamo's water needs have risen with the base's population, which
went from 2,500 three years ago to nearly 10,000 as the main detention
facility for terrorism suspects.
</P>
<P>
``The water needs for the base have been very complicated because
we were small, then large, then small again, now large again,''
Johnston said of the Guantanamo operation, which has shrunk and
swollen with the times, including when it housed waves of intercepted
refugees from Haiti and Cuba a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
``I don't know enough about the future of this base to invest too
much more'' in energy or water production, Johnston said. ``We are but
a flotilla of Haitians away from being a base of 30,000 people. I
could draw realistic scenarios that have this base at three times its
needs now or one-third.''
</P>
<P>
While the wind turbines replace diesel power produced by plants
that consume $24 in fuel a minute, their contribution to the base
electrical grid can't be efficiently increased beyond the four units.
Unlike diesel-powered plants that can be operated as needed, wind is
variable and unpredictable, Johnston said. The good news, he added, is
that peak wind times on the base tend to coincide with peak
consumption hours of late afternoon and early evening.
</P>
<P>
The windmills will also help the base overcome a chronic problem of
power outages. Because the base network of diesel generators lacks the
backup power supplies that a private utility company would have at its
disposal, breakdowns, though usually short in duration, often put the
lights out across the base until the problem can be fixed.
</P>
<P>
Johnston and the base commander, Capt. Leslie J. McCoy, noted that
Cuban military officials with whom they met periodically had been
keenly interested in the wind project, which is now$the most visible
feature of the base from any direction.
</P>
<P>
``The Cubans are very intrigued by the wind generators, but I see
no potential for sharing the technology at this time,'' McCoy said,
alluding to the absence of diplomatic relations with Havana and a
trade embargo that has been in place since shortly after Castro came
to power in 1959.
</P>
<P>
Cuba has suffered widespread and protracted electricity outages in
recent years as the price of oil has driven up production costs. The
country has invested little in developing alternative energy
resources.
</P>
<P>
Whether the Navy and its neighbor might collaborate in wind-power
production if more amicable relations are achieved is ``difficult to
predict,'' the base commander said.
