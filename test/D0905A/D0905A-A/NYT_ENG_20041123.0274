COLORADANS VOTE TO EMBRACE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF ENERGY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
FORT COLLINS, Colo.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Colorado utilities will have to sell a lot more electricity from wind
power in years to come under a statewide ballot initiative approved
by voters on Nov. 2, and if they want some pointers they might talk
to Adam T. Kremers, a 19-year-old sophomore at Colorado State
University here. He's been there and done that.
</P>
<P>
Kremers sold wind power to the occupants of individual dormitory
rooms this fall, under a deal between the university and the local
utility that environmentalists describe as one of the first such
programs in the nation.
</P>
<P>
Kremers, an environmental engineering major and the associate
director of environmental affairs in the student government, gave out
stickers and pinwheels shaped like turbines and threw a "wind power
party" to celebrate clean energy, complete with a cake connived from
the dining hall.
</P>
<P>
He ultimately got 187 students -- nearly 4 percent of the
university's 5,000 residence-hall population -- to sign up, paying
from $17 to $52 a year extra to buy green power to run their
computers and lava lamps.
</P>
<P>
"It's a start," he said. "Now it's my duty to keep it going."
</P>
<P>
Colorado voters said much the same thing when they approved, over the
vehement objections of most energy companies, a proposal mandating
that 10 percent of the state's electricity must come from wind and
solar power by 2015.
</P>
<P>
The new law, called Amendment 37, makes Colorado the 18th state with
an environmentally friendly energy standard, but the first one to
have bypassed the Legislature and put the rule into place through
referendum. An energy bill similar to the one the voters approved was
defeated by Colorado's legislature three times in the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
"Because it's a conservative Western state with a strong fossil-fuel
industry, as well as the first one passed by a popular referendum,
Colorado represents something of a breakthrough," said Alan Nogee,
the energy program director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a
nonprofit research and advocacy group based in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
And Fort Collins, a city of 118,000 people dominated culturally by
the 25,000-student university got there first.
</P>
<P>
The city created its own wind energy program in 1998, and its own
renewable energy standard in 2003 -- a step that only a few other
municipalities in the nation, notably Chicago and Austin, Texas, have
taken.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, about 2 percent of the city's customer base and
electricity load now comes from wind power, purchased from wind farms
in Wyoming through a nonprofit power authority. The idea is that each
purchase of wind power fed into the grid offsets fossil-fuel use.
Colorado gets most of its electricity from burning coal.
</P>
<P>
It was from that municipal utility framework, city and school
officials say, that the dormitory project took root. And just like
Amendment 37, which clawed its way onto the ballot through petitions,
what happened on the campus came entirely from the bottom up. People
like Kremers and a former student, Britta Schroeder, his predecessor
at the student government's environment job, prodded and pushed until
they found a way.
</P>
<P>
"It was almost all exclusively the students doing this," said Carol
Dollard, a utility engineer at the university who got involved in the
residence hall project. The pitch to the administration, she said,
was that wind energy would be an entirely optional added cost for
students, and that the grunt work would be done by the students
themselves. "We sold it as zero cost, zero effort," she said.
</P>
<P>
Kremers, who has a quotation from Gandhi on the door of his dorm room
-- "Be the change you wish to see in the world" -- considers the new
state law a wonderful boost to what's happening on campus.
</P>
<P>
Fort Collins officials are more guarded. They say that as one of a
small number of "home rule" cities that run their own electric
systems in Colorado, they want to opt out of the new state law
because they believe their energy program is better.
</P>
<P>
It is certainly more ambitious, requiring 15 percent of the energy
sold in city limits to come from wind sources by 2017, 50 percent
more than the state requirement. City officials also don't like the
idea of interference by the state Public Utility Commission, which
will oversee the statewide standards, and they worry as well that the
Legislature could amend the plan.
</P>
<P>
The Fort Collins city council voted to remain neutral on Amendment 37
before the election. Statewide, the measure got the support of
slightly more than half the electorate -- 53.4 percent voted for it,
to 46.6 percent against.
</P>
<P>
"Does the PUC have jurisdiction over a home-rule city? That's what
people were worried about," said Michael B. Smith, the general
manager of utilities for Fort Collins. "We will be closely watching
what happens."
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists who backed Amendment 37 noted that it includes
specific language intended to protect Fort Collins, and other cities
that might join its ranks with local standards, allowing them to
self-certify out of the program.
</P>
<P>
But they also admitted that because the measure was passed as an
ordinary state law, it could be amended by the Legislature -- or
repealed, though hardly anyone expects that to happen -- and that the
Public Utility Commission will also have to work out the details of
enacting it over the next year.
</P>
<P>
"It's a statute, so the legislature can change it however it sees
fit, but I would hope that since it was passed by the voice of the
people, they would respect that," said the measure's principal
author, Rick Gilliam, a senior energy policy adviser at Western
Resource Advocates, a nonprofit environment law and policy center.
"My hope is that we would at least go forward into the PUC realm
before the legislature tinkers with it."
</P>
<P>
At the university, plans are under way for next year's wind campaign.
Dollard, the utility engineer, said that one proposal would extend
the wind power option to individual professors, and departments that
might want to buy some or all their energy from the city's wind
program.
</P>
<P>
"It was a three-year process to get the residence halls through, so
we've said let's not take on too many things until we've learned the
lessons from the first part," she said.
</P>
<P>
Kremers, meanwhile, is plotting how to get financing for his
second-year marketing plan. He wants to print up advertising cards
that could be put in every mailbox of next year's incoming freshman
class -- about 5,000 students -- and he has a strategy in mind.
</P>
<P>
The university's recycling committee, mostly composed of faculty and
administration, works on issues like reducing waste in the dining
halls, and he is the student representative on the board.
</P>
<P>
"The recycling committee has a good budget," he said. "We'll see."
