US lawmakers expressed "grave 
concern" Wednesday over a Chinese law giving legal backing for an 
invasion of Taiwan if the country moves toward formal independence.

The US House of Representatives voted 424-4 in favor of a 
resolution warning that the anti-secession legislation alters "the 
status quo in the region, and thus is of grave concern to the United 
States."

The resolution urges President George W. Bush to direct US 
officials to express to their Chinese counterparts "the grave 
concern with which the United States views the passage of China's 
anti-secession law in particular, and the growing Chinese military 
threats to Taiwan in general."

<P>
"The Government of the United States should reaffirm its policy 
that the future of Taiwan should be resolved by peaceful means and 
with the consent of the people of Taiwan," it said, adding that the 
US government should continue to encourage dialogue between Taiwan 
and China.

China's National People's Congress passed the law on Monday.
