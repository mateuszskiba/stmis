President Chen Shui-bian called for the
nation Friday to seriously face Beijing's proposed anti-secession law
which he said would undermine stability across the Taiwan Strait if
enacted.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks while reviewing the operations and
capability of an army unit in Pingtung, southern Taiwan.

<P>
Chen said that Beijing has been actively engaging in
"psychological, legal and media warfare" in pushing to enact the
anti-secession law, which he said is aimed at establishing a legal
justification for a military invasion of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee late last
year placed the anti-secession bill on the agenda for the annual
session of the NPC set for this March.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated remarks he made in his New Year's
address in which he condemned Beijing's plans to enact an
anti-secession law as a unilateral attempt to change the status quo
in the Taiwan Strait. Chen called the proposed law the biggest threat
to regional stability and peace in the world.
