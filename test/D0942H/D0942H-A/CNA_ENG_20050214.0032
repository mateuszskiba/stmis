Both the United States and the European
Union think mainland China's planned anti-secession legislation is
counterproductive to peace across the Taiwan Strait, Minister of
Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks after presiding over a Lunar New Year
gathering at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) auditorium.
</P>
<P>
He said the government sent six delegations to the United States,
Japan and EU countries last year to brief officials, academics and
opinion leaders on the adverse impact on cross-strait relations of
Beijing's planned anti-secession law, which targets Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The MOFA has also instructed embassies and representative offices
abroad to express to their host governments Taiwan's opposition to
the proposed legislation, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The mainland's rubber-stamp parliament -- the National People's
Congress -- is scheduled to screen the so-called anti-secession law
in March. Chen said such a move could draw a backlash and protests
from the people of Taiwan and could hinder cross-strait
rapprochement.
