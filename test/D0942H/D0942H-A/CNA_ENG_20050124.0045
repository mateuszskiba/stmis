The enacting of an anti-secession law by
Beijing will diminish cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges and thus will be
harmful to the development of bilateral ties, a scholar said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shu Yung-ming, an assistant researcher with Academia Sinica,
Taiwan's highest research institute, said in a seminar that the
people of Taiwan will be afraid of visiting the mainland after the
legislation is approved due to its ambiguous definition of
secessionist activities.
</P>
<P>
The people of Taiwan could be arrested when visiting the mainland
because of remarks they might make in Taiwan and other areas that are
considered by the Beijing authorities as violations of the proposed
law, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he went on, none of the candidates running for public
office in Taiwan can avoid expressing their opposition to the
proposed law during their campaigns under the country's current
political circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he continued, the enacting of the anti-secession law
will squeeze the political space of those who actually support
Taiwan's reunification with the mainland.
