<P>
An envoy of Nepalese King Gyanendra 
Sunday met Indian Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran and briefed him 
about the situation in the Himalayan kingdom, almost a month after 
the monarch sacked the government and seized absolute power, a 
report said.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India news agency said Sharad Chandra Shah, a 
close aide of Gyanendra, is in New Delhi to attend a conference but 
also used the opportunity to clear the air of "misapprehensions".
</P>
<P>
Saran explained the need for immediate restoration of the 
democratic process in Nepal, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal wanted India to show "greater understanding" to its 
sensitivities, saying King Gyanendra needed time to restore the 
democratic process, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Indian foreign ministry officials were unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
Gyanendra Thursday promised to restore democracy in the 
Himalayan kingdom in the next three years. He said sacking the 
government had been a last resort.
</P>
<P>
India has been sharply critical of the king's appointing a 
pro-royalist cabinet headed by himself and declaring a state of 
emergency in the Himalayan kingdom on February 1.
</P>
<P>
India, along with the United States and Britain, has been an 
important backer of Nepal in its drive to crush a Maoist insurgency 
that has sapped the economy of one of the poorest countries in the 
world.
</P>
<P>
India, which shares a nearly 1,600-kilometer (990-mile) border 
with the Himalayan kingdom, is concerned the Maoist violence in 
Nepal, which has claimed 11,000 lives since 1996, could spill into 
Indian states where radical leftist groups are powerful.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, India and Britain announced a suspension of military 
aid to Nepal.
