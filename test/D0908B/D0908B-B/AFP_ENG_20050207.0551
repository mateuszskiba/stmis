<P>
The White House said Monday that it 
had "real concerns" about over the February 1 power grab by Nepal's 
King Gyanendra and urged him to enact democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
"We have real concerns about the steps back from democracy that 
have been taken in Nepal," said spokesman Scott McClellan. "We will 
continue to make our views known to the government in Nepal."
</P>
<P>
Gyanendra, who controls the army, last week fired the government 
for failing to organise elections and for failing to end the Maoist 
insurgency, named a loyalist cabinet under his chairmanship, 
declared a state of emergency and pledged to restore multi-party 
democracy in three years.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime scores of political leaders, party and union 
leaders are under arrest, press censorship has been imposed and any 
criticism of the king's action has been banned.
</P>
<P>
"We urge everybody to continue to move forward on democratic 
reforms, and that includes the government of Nepal. It is a concern, 
the steps that they have taken," said McClellan.
</P>
<P>
Washington provides Nepal's army with badly needed weapons and 
training in its fight against Maoist rebels, considered by 
Washington as terrorists. The revolt has claimed more than 11,000 
lives since 1996.
