Nepal's media has been "suffocated" 
through a climate of fear and self-censorship since King Gyanendra 
seized power, the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) said 
Thursday.

In a statement issued by the Brussels-based organisation during 
a visit to Kathmandu by its president, Christopher Warren, the IFJ 
said journalists' fear for their safety were among the factors 
"crippling" democracy in Nepal.

"Since King Gyanendra's royal coup on February 1, he and his 
army have suffocated the media by directly enforcing censorship 
through armed military intervention and indirectly fostering a 
climate of fear and self-censorship," Warren said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of this sweeping censorship, media organisations 
have been sh to 
visit Misturi in the past week and found him to be "very well, 
healthy", and keen to renew his anti-government protests if released 
by a court.
