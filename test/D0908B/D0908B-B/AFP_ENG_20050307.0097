NEW DELHI, March 7

<TEXT>
<P>
Nepal's foreign minister met his 
Indian counterpart in New Delhi Monday in the first ministerial 
contact between the neighbours since King Gyanendra seized power in 
the Himalayan kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Nepalese Foreign Minister Ramesh Nath Pandey arrived here early 
Monday on a three-day working visit, a foreign ministry official 
said.
</P>
<P>
He held talks over lunch with Indian Foreign Minister Natwar 
Singh.
</P>
<P>
Pandey, appointed to his post by Gyanendra, was accompanied by a 
delegation that included foreign secretary Madhu Raman Acharya.
</P>
<P>
"The visit is related to the current political situation in 
Nepal," the Press Trust of India news agency quoted an unnamed 
Nepalese official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The visit to New Delhi is Pandey's first trip outside Nepal 
since the king who assumed absolute power by dismissing the 
government on February 1.
</P>
<P>
Gyanendra imposed emergency rule and suspended civil liberties, 
saying he was forced to act to tackle a nine-year Maoist revolt that 
has claimed more than 11,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
India has strongly condemned Gyanendra's power grab and urged an 
immediate restoration of democracy in the country.
</P>
<P>
It has joined Britain in cutting off military aid to the Nepal, 
which is heavily dependent on foreign support for the battle that it 
has been waging since 1996 against the Maoist insurgents.
</P>
<P>
India, which shares a nearly 1,600-kilometer (990-mile) border 
with the Himalayan kingdom, is also concerned Maoist violence in 
Nepal could spill into Indian states where radical leftist groups 
are powerful.
</P>
<P>
Pandey's visit follows a visit to New Delhi last month by Sharad 
Chandra Shah, a close aide of Gyanendra.
</P>
<P>
Shah, who met Indian Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran, said Nepal 
wanted India to show "greater understanding" of its problems, adding 
King Gyanendra needed time to restore democracy.
</P>
<P>
Gyanendra has said he will restore democracy and peace in the 
kingdom, nestled between India and China, in three years.
