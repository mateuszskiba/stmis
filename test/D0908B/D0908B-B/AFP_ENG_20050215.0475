<P>
Norway on Tuesday followed the United 
States, the European Union and India in recalling its ambassador in 
Nepal to protest King Gyanendra's seizure of absolute power.
</P>
<P>
"In light of the latest developments in Nepal, the Norwegian 
ambassador Tore Toreng has been recalled today (Tuesday) for 
consultations," the Norwegian foreign ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
On February 1, Nepal's King Gyanendra sacked the government, 
claiming it had failed to quell a Maoist insurgency that has claimed 
more than 11,000 lives since 1996.
</P>
<P>
He then appointed a pro-royalist cabinet headed by himself and 
declared a state of emergency in the Himalayan kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the move, the Maoist rebels have declared a 
general blockade, which they say will continue until Gyanendra 
reverses his actions, and the Nepalese army has been put on high 
alert.
</P>
<P>
The dissolution of the Nepalese government is a "serious setback 
for democracy," Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen said in the 
statement.
</P>
<P>
Norway, which is not an EU member, also implied that it might 
freeze aid to Nepal if the situation there does not improve.
