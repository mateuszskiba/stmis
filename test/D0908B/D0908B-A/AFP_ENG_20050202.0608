<P>
The European Union on Wednesday joined 
international condemnation of Nepalese King Gyanendra's dismissal of 
his government and swearing in of a new cabinet dominated by 
royalists.
</P>
<P>
The EU's Luxembourg presidency called for a "speedy" return to 
multi-party democracy.
</P>
<P>
"The EU is deeply concerned about the dissolution of the 
multiparty government in Nepal and the decision by the king to 
assume executive powers," it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This represents a serious setback to multiparty democracy. The 
EU has consistently supported multiparty democracy and 
constitutional monarchy in Nepal," it said.
</P>
<P>
Gyanendra said he fired the government of Prime Minister Sher 
Bahadur Deuba for failing to hold elections or to bring peace to a 
country racked by an increasingly deadly Maoist revolt.
</P>
<P>
The monarch, vaulted to the throne four years ago by a palace 
massacre that wiped out most of the royal family, pledged to 
"restore democracy and law and order in the country in the next 
three years."
</P>
<P>
The EU said this was not good enough. "In the present situation, 
the EU sees no alternative to a broad-based government. ... The EU 
calls for the speedy restoration of multiparty democracy in Nepal to 
better meet the aspirations of the Nepalese people," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The EU continues to judge that there can be no acceptable 
military solution to Nepal's problems and that any search for a 
solution by military means by either side will only add to and 
prolong the suffering of the Nepalese people."
