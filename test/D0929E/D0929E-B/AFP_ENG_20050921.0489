Houston Mayor Bill White on 
Wednesday urged residents in low lying areas to leave the path of 
powerful Hurricane Rita as it churned toward Texas.
</P>
<P>
"Hurricane Rita on its present course poses a risk to Houston 
and the whole Houston region," White told a press conference in 
Texas.
</P>
<P>
"We are asking all residents in the Houston area and the greater 
Houston area that are in the storm surge area for a hurricane of 
this force and above to begin making their evacuation plans.
</P>
<P>
"We are calling for volunteer evacuations from several different 
areas. First, those areas that are in the storm surge areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Second, if you are in a 100-year flood plain, in an area that 
has experienced flooding in the past, those include many areas along 
some of the major bayou waterways. We want you to voluntarily 
evacuate and make your plans for voluntary evacuations now and 
implement those plans."
</P>
<P>
He also urged those in mobile homes to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
Rita, packing winds of 215 kilometers (135 miles) per hour, was 
upgraded to a category-four storm on the five-level Saffir-Simpson 
intensity scale as it bore down on Texas, where inhabitants of 
Galveston were ordered to flee the city.
