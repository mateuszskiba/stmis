"Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 140 mph (224 
kilometers per hour) with higher gusts," said Lixion Avila, a 
forecaster with the Miami-based NHC.

"Rita is an extremely dangerous category four hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson scale. Some additional strengthening is forecast 
during the next 24 hours and could reach category five intensity in 
the central Gulf of Mexico," he said.

Forecasters believe the storm will make landfall in Texas over 
the weekend, but do not rule out it may hit further east on the 
Louisiana coast.
