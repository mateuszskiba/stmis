British energy giant BP said on 
Wednesday that it was evacuating staff from Gulf of Mexico oil 
facilities, after a similar move by Royal Dutch Shell, as Hurricane 
Rita approached the region.
</P>
<P>
"We have evacuated all non-essential personnel to ensure their 
safety," a BP spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
BP said it has removed half of its 1,500 employees working at 
its offshore facilities in the eastern and central parts of the 
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Anglo-Dutch energy giant Royal Dutch Shell has meanwhile removed 
some 545 staff from its platforms since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to monitor the situation closely and respond 
to further developments," a Royal Dutch Shell statement said.
</P>
<P>
Rita -- which strengthened to hurricane status on Tuesday -- was 
tracking a path that could roughly follow that of recent Hurricane 
Katrina into the Gulf of Mexico, where about one-quarter of US oil 
operations are based.
