<P>
Oil prices were higher in Asian trade 
Wednesday as Hurricane Rita pounded the Florida Keys islands before 
barreling into the Gulf of Mexico where much of US production is 
sourced, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
At 12:30 pm (0430 GMT), New York's main contract, light sweet 
crude for November delivery, was up 1.28 dollars at 67.48 dollars a 
barrel from its close of 66.20 dollars in the United States 
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Now it is all about Hurricane Rita," said Victor Shum, an 
analyst with US energy consultancy Purvin and Gertz in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"That is driving up prices at the moment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rita, expected to become a major storm, was tracking a path that 
could roughly follow that of Hurricane Katrina into the Gulf of 
Mexico where about one-quarter of US oil operations are based.
</P>
<P>
The path, while still uncertain, could take the powerful new 
storm toward Texas or possibly Louisiana, where it would likely 
inflict further damage on the US energy industry.
</P>
<P>
Gulf of Mexico production has only been starting to recover from 
the shutdown caused by Katrina late last month.
</P>
<P>
Now with Rita approaching, more than 58 percent of crude oil 
drilling and about 35 percent of natural gas production has been 
suspended, according to US government figures Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The US government also said 46 oil platforms had been destroyed 
by Katrina and 20 severely damaged while several refineries remain 
shut.
</P>
<P>
Just the fear of Rita moving into the region sparked a jump of 
about seven percent in crude oil futures on Monday, while gasoline 
futures spiked 14.4 percent. There was some pullback in prices 
Tuesday but the markets remained nervous.
</P>
<P>
"There are many facilities around Houston, especially natural 
gas facilities, offshore rigs and underground pipeline systems," 
said Mike Fitzpatrick, analyst at Fimat USA.
