LONDON, Sept 21
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
World oil prices made strong gains on 
Wednesday, as Hurricane Rita threatened fresh damage to energy 
facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in 
November climbed 1.12 dollars to 67.32 dollars per barrel in 
electronic trading.
</P>
<P>
The October contract expired Tuesday at 66.23 dollars per 
barrel.
</P>
<P>
In London, the price of Brent North Sea crude for November 
delivery gained 94 cents to 65.14 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Concern over Rita had boosted oil prices by more than four 
dollars on Monday, before they slid a day later on profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
Rita was tracking a path that could roughly follow that of 
recent Hurricane Katrina into the Gulf of Mexico where about 
one-quarter of US oil operations are based.
</P>
<P>
Traders were meanwhile awaiting the latest weekly snapshot of US 
crude inventories, whose publication later Wednesday would show the 
extent to which stockpiles were recovering following the destruction 
to rigs and refineries caused by Katrina late last month.
</P>
<P>
"The market is now concerned that Hurricane Rita could extend 
the time that these facilities are offline for and even cause fresh 
damage," Sucden analyst Sam Tilley said.
</P>
<P>
"The market will also be watching the US crude inventory 
figures," he added.
