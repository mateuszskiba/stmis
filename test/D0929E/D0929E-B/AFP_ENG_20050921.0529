<P>
Texas officials on Wednesday 
urged voluntary evacuations of residents from areas that could lie 
in the path of powerful Hurricane Rita as it churned ominously 
toward their state.
</P>
<P>
"Though Rita may weaken to a Category Four storm from that 
Category Five by the time it hits the shore, it is quite likely it 
will be a devastating storm when it reaches Texas. That's why I'm 
encouraging coastal residents from Corpus Christi to Beaumont area 
to voluntarily evacuate if they have the means," Texas Governor Rick 
Perry said.
</P>
<P>
President George W. Bush meanwhile urged people to heed local 
authorities' evacuation orders.
</P>
<P>
"Mandatory evacuations have been ordered for New Orleans and 
Galveston. I urge the citizens to listen carefully to the 
instructions provided by state and local authorities. And follow 
them," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope and pray that Hurricane Rita will not be a devastating 
storm. But we got to be ready for the worst."
</P>
<P>
Rita, the second big hurricane in less than four weeks, has 
strengthened to a category four storm on the five level 
Saffir-Simpson scale and is headed toward the US Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
The death toll from last month's Hurricane Katrina rose above 
1,000 Wednesday as 63 more bodies have been recovered in Louisiana, 
authorities said in Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
Houston Mayor Bill White on Wednesday urged residents in low 
lying areas to leave Rita's striking range.
</P>
<P>
"Hurricane Rita on its present course poses a risk to Houston 
and the whole Houston region," White told a press conference in 
Texas.
</P>
<P>
"We are asking all residents in the Houston area and the greater 
Houston area that are in the storm surge area for a hurricane of 
this force and above to begin making their evacuation plans.
</P>
<P>
"We are calling for volunteer evacuations from several different 
areas. First, those areas that are in the storm surge areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Second, if you are in a 100-year flood plain, in an area that 
has experienced flooding in the past, those include many areas along 
some of the major bayou waterways. We want you to voluntarily 
evacuate and make your plans for voluntary evacuations now and 
implement those plans."
</P>
<P>
He also urged those in mobile homes to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
Rita, packing winds of 215 kilometers (135 miles) per hour, was 
upgraded to a category-four storm on the five-level Saffir-Simpson 
intensity scale as it bore down on Texas, where inhabitants of 
Galveston were ordered to flee the city.
</P>
<P>
Perry stressed "there's no need to panic. We've been preparing 
for this type of event for a number of years. We have run a great 
many training exercises for an event such as this.
</P>
<P>
"We reevaluated and we have improved our hurricane preparedness 
plans after Florida was hit four times in one year. We are doing 
everything we can to prepare for this storm," the Texas governor 
said.
